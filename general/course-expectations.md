## Written reports and oral presentations

Some classes have written reports and/or oral presentations.

You must **prepare the report/presentation yourself**. Do not ask someone else to write your paper or develop your presentation slides. **Do not plagiarize** any other works. You can **reuse work** that you have done in another class or in your job, but be sure to acknowledge this appropriately. You can **use Internet resources** like large language models to help develop your report/presentation, but you alone are responsible for the accuracy of your work.

Once the first draft of the report/presentation is written, you can get ask fellow students and/or colleagues for **help on grammar, style, and organization**. In fact, this is encouraged. Please be sure to **acknowledge any assistance** you have received. It won't affect your grade, but it is a nice habit to develop. **Cite any Internet resources** that you rely on, including the use of large language models.

## Quizzes and final exams

All classes have quizzes and some have a final exam.

You only get **one opportunity** for any quiz or exam, so plan your time carefully. You can **review any material** such as slides and videos prepared for this class, books (either the required textbook or another book). You can search for **information on the Internet** and **consult any non-human resource** like a large language model. There is one restriction: **you cannot consult another human being**, either directly or by posting a question on a discussion board that other humans participate on.

## Programming assignments

Some classes have programming assignments. 

You are expected to **write your programs by yourself**. You cannot ask someone
else to write the program for you. You **can search for and find program code**
on the Internet that you can modify to meet the requirements of your assignment.
**Also acceptable, using a large language model** like ChatGPT to generate code
(if you know how to do it).

## If your program doesn't run

Most programs do not run the very first time. You might see a cryptic
**warning or error message**, or you **may not get the output that you wanted.**
You have two options.

-   Fix the error yourself
-   Seek help from others

## Fix the error yourself, 1

If you can, **try to fix the problem yourself**. Review the class material and
**compare to the sample programs** you have received with your code. Look 
closely because **very small inconsistencies can create big** problems.
[Additional help on fixing things yourself][ref01] is available on my gihub
site.

## Fix the error yourself, 2

There is **value in struggling** through and trying different things. If your
program fails the first nine times, and gets good results the tenth time, that's
good. **Repeated failures followed by a success helps you learn better** than if
you get the program working right on the very first time.

There will be times, though, where you find yourself banging your head against
the wall in frustration. If it **takes more than an hour** to fix a problem and
you feel like you are not making any progress, don't torture yourself. Proceed
to the next step.

## Seek help from others

**Your teachers are always available** to assist with any programming problem.
In fact, **we love students who ask for help**. The interactions that we get are
a big part of what we enjoy about teaching.

You can also get help from others. Ask your fellow **students**, your 
**co-workers**, your **colleagues**. While they can't write the program for you,
they can help fix a broken program. **Getting help to fix a bug isn't cheating,**
from our perspective, because in the real world, you are allowed to seek help from others to get your job done.
