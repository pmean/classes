## You must write your own program

You are expected to write your programs by yourself. You cannot ask someone else to write the program for you. You can search for and find program code on the Internet that you can modify to meet the needs of the assignment. Also acceptable, if you know how to do it: using a large language model like ChatGPT to generate code.

## If your program doesn't run

Most programs do not run properly the first time. You may see a warning or error message, or you may find that your code does not produce the output that you wanted. You have two options.

-   Fix the error yourself
-   Seek help from others

## Fix the error yourself

If you can, try to fix the problem yourself. Review the class material and compare any sample programs you have received with the code you have written. Look closely and carefully because even very small inconsistencies can create big problems. [Additional help on fixing things yourself][ref01] is available on my gihub site.

There is value in struggling through and trying different things. If your program fails the first nine times, and gets good results the tenth time, that's good. Repeated failures followed by a success helps you learn better than if you get the program working right on the very first time.

There will be times, though, where you find yourself banging your head against the wall in frustration. If it takes more than an hour to fix a problem and you feel like you are not making any progress, don't torture yourself. Proceed to the next step.

## Seek help from others

Your teachers are always available to assist with any programming problem. In fact, we love students who ask for help. The interactions that we get are a big part of what we enjoy about teaching.

You can also get help from others. Ask your fellow students, your co-workers, your colleagues. While they can't write the program for you, they can help you fix a program that doesn't work. It's not cheating, from our perspective, because in the real world, you are allowed to seek help from others to get your job done.

## Grading rubric: general requirements.

There are standards in five general areas

-   Documentation
-   Graphs
-   Tables
-   Readability
-   Interpretation
-   Conciseness

There may be times when one or two of these standards do not apply. Which standards apply should be obvious from the nature of the programming assignment.

## Documentation is required!

Documentation should include

-   the name of the author (you!),
-   the creation date, 
-   the purpose of your program, and 
-   any restrictions on use (your choice).
    -    Public domain (no restrictions)
    -    Specific restrictions on how others can use your program

## Graphs cannot rely on default choices, 1

Always modify your graphs. Do not settle for the default options

-   Include your name and date on the title of any graph
    -   "Steve Simon produced this graph on 2023-09-19."
-   Avoid unnecessary decimal places
    -   Use 10, 20, 30 and not 10.00, 20.00, 30.00
-   Use comma separators for large numbers
    -   Anything larger than 999 needs a comma.
-   Replace category codes with descriptive labels

## Graphs cannot rely on default choices, 2

-   Replace short variable names with longer descriptors
    -   Include units of measurement, if needed
-   Avoid the gratuitous use of color
    -   Unless needed to distinguish between groups
-   Fill boxes and points with white/transparent colors
    -  Use ○ and not ⬤

## Tables also need modification

-   Round to two or three significant figures
-   Use comma separators if numbers are >= 1,000
-   Avoid scientific notation (e.g., 1.23E-04)
-   Avoid small p-values (e.g., p=0.000)
    -   Change to p<0.001
-   Suppress the printing of unneeded tables
    -   Sometimes difficult
-   Unmodified table acceptable with a detailed text description

## Your code must be easy to read

-   Make liberal use of
    -  blank lines
    -  line breaks
    -  indenting
    -  vertical lists

## Always include an interpretation

-   Use simple evaluative words
    -   Young/Elderly
    -   Less than half/more than half
    -   Almost all/almost none
    -   Substantial improvement/roughly comparable
-   Depends on context
    -   No penalty for subjective judgments

## Be concise


-   Things to leave out
    -   Lengthy printouts of raw data
    -   Descriptive statistics on unused variables
    -   Analyses beyond what was asked for
-   Variables worth describing
    -   Dependent/outcome variable
    -   Independent variables
    -   Demographic profile

## Grading rubric for a ten point assignment

-  Four points for general requirements
-  Six points for Accuracy
-  Adjust proportionately for different point totals


## General requirements

-   How well did you follow the general requirements?
    -   Poor (0 points) Two or more major problems with general requirements.
    -   Fair (2 points) One major or two minor problems with general requirements.
    -   Good (4 points) Includes all required elements, ignoring elements that are not applicable for this particular assignment.

## Accuracy

-   How accurate was your work?    
    -   Poor (0 points): Three or more major errors or omissions
    -   Fair (2 points): Two major or four minor errors or omissions
    -   Good (4 points): One major or two minor errors or omissions
    -   Excellent (6 points): Complete and accurate answers to all questions
