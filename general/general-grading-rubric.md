### General requirements.

Some of the general requirements listed below are not easy to meet. You cannot always rely on the default options that your program produces. Pay attention in class because you will see examples of how to meet these general requirements.

**Documentation**. You must include a documentation header at or near the top of every programming assignment. Your documentation header must include

-   the name of the author (you!),
-   the creation date, 
-   the purpose of your program, and 
-   any restrictions on use.

You can choose to place your program in the public domain (no restrictions) or you can specify restrictions on how others can use your program (e.g., no commercial use). This is entirely your discretion.

**Graphs**. If the assignment requires graphs, you must modify the graphs to publication quality. This means

-   Avoiding the display of unnecessary decimal places on the axes
-   Replacing category codes with descriptive labels
-   Replacing short variable names with longer descriptors
    -   Include units of measurement, if needed
-   Using comma separators for large numbers
-   Avoiding the use of color, unless it is needed to distinguish between groups.
    -   Use either white or transparent color to fill boxes and points.
-   Including your name and date on the title of any graph
    -   For example, "This graph was produced by Steve Simon on 2023-09-19."

**Tables** If the assignment requires the production of tabular data (other than a listing of the data itself), you must ensure that the table is easily readable. This means rounding values and using comma separators either in the table itself or in your interpretation of the table. Any p-values smaller than 0.001 should be rounded up to "0.001" or replaced with "<0.001". A p-value of "0.000" is not acceptable. Avoid the use of scientific notation.

**Readability**. Your code should be easy to read. You should make liberal use of
-  line breaks,
-  white space,
-  vertical lists

If you are using a system like SPSS that is largely menu driven, please include the syntax in a separate file and modify the syntax to make it more readable.

**Interpretation** For anything more complicated than a simple listing of the data, you should provide an interpretation. If you report an average age of 70.2 and a range of 65 to 85, it would be reasonable to use the word "elderly" in your description. A proportion of 0.45 could be described as "less than half" and a proportion of 0.89 as "almost all". A difference between two groups might include evaluative words like "substantial improvement" or "roughly comparable". Characterize a confidence interval as either wide or narrow and note whether it includes the null value. State the practical implications if you accept the null hypothesis.

The actual interpretation depends largely on the context of the problem and you will not be penalized for subjective assessments. You can call a small difference as large or a large difference as small. You will lose points, however, if you fail to include any description.

Depending on the software you use and the question you are addressing, you might present your interpretation as comments in your code, as a title on your graph or table, or as a separate block of text.

### Grading rubric

This grading rubric is for an assignment worth 10 points. Change these numbers proportionately for an assignment worth a different number of points (e.g, triple all the point values for an assignment worth 30 points).

-   How well did you follow the general requirements specified above?
    -    Poor (0 points) Two or more major problems with documentation, graphs, tables, readability, or interpretation.
    -    Fair (2 points) One major or two minor problems with documentation, graphs, tables, readability, or interpretation.
    -    Good (4 points) Includes all required elements

-   How accurate was your work?    
    -   Poor (0 points): Three or more major errors or omissions
    -   Fair (2 points): Two major or four minor errors or omissions
    -   Good (4 points): One major or two minor errors or omissions
    -   Excellent (6 points): Complete and accurate answers to all questions
