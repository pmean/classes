## Grading rubric: general requirements.

There are **standards in six areas**:

-   Documentation
-   Graphs
-   Tables
-   Readability
-   Interpretation
-   Conciseness

There **may be times when one or two of these standards do not apply**. Which
standards apply and which don't should be obvious from the nature of the 
programming assignment.

## Documentation is required!

Documentation should include

-   the name of the author (you!),
-   the creation date, 
-   the purpose of your program, and 
-   any restrictions on use (your choice).
    -    Public domain (no restrictions)
    -    Specific restrictions on how others can use your program

## Graphs cannot rely on default choices, 1

Always modify your graphs. **Do not settle for the default options**.

-   Include your name and date on the title of any graph
    -   "Steve Simon produced this graph on 2023-09-19."
-   Avoid unnecessary decimal places
    -   Use 10, 20, 30 and not 10.00, 20.00, 30.00
-   Use comma separators for large numbers
    -   Anything larger than 999 needs a comma.
-   Replace category codes with descriptive labels

## Graphs cannot rely on default choices, 2

-   Replace short variable names with longer descriptors
    -   Include units of measurement, if needed
-   Avoid the gratuitous use of color
    -   Unless needed to distinguish between groups
-   Fill boxes and points with white/transparent colors
    -  Use ○ and not ⬤

## Tables also need modification

-   Round to two or three significant figures
-   Use comma separators if numbers are >= 1,000
-   Avoid scientific notation (e.g., 1.23E-04)
-   Avoid small p-values (e.g., p=0.000)
    -   Change to p<0.001
-   Suppress the printing of unneeded tables
-   Some programs (e.g., SAS) do not make it easy to modify tables. If you cannot round and use nice formats, make sure that your interpretations meet these goals.

## Sometimes default tables/graphs acceptable

-   Early assignments may ask for defaults
-   Always round and specify units in your interpretations

## Your code must be easy to read

-   Make liberal use of
    -  blank lines
    -  line breaks
    -  indenting
    -  vertical lists

## Always include an interpretation

-   Use simple evaluative words
    -   Young/Elderly
    -   Less than half/more than half
    -   Almost all/almost none
    -   Substantial improvement/roughly comparable
-   Depends on context
    -   No penalty for subjective judgments

## Be concise

-   Things to leave out
    -   Lengthy printouts of raw data
    -   Descriptive statistics on unused variables
    -   Analyses beyond what was asked for
-   Variables worth describing
    -   Dependent/outcome variable
    -   Independent variables
    -   Demographic profile

## Conciseness

-   Do not include analyses that were not asked for
-   Avoid displaying excessively large tables
    -   This may be difficult for SAS and SPSS

## Grading rubric for a ten point assignment

-  Four points for general requirements
   -   Documentation
   -   Graphs
   -   Tables
   -   Readability
   -   Interpretation
   -   Conciseness
-  Six points for Accuracy
-  Adjust proportionately for different point totals


## How well did you follow the general requirements?

-   Poor (0 points) Two or more major problems with documentation, graphs, tables, readability, interpretation, or conciseness.
-   Fair (2 points) One major or two minor problems
-   Good (4 points) No major or minor problems

Note: **some general requirements may not be applicable** for a particular 
assignment (e.g., the assignment does not require any graphs). This should be 
obvious from the context of the assignment.

## Accuracy

-   How accurate was your work?    
    -   Poor (0 points): Three or more major errors or omissions
    -   Fair (2 points): Two major or four minor errors or omissions
    -   Good (4 points): One major or two minor errors or omissions
    -   Excellent (6 points): Complete and accurate answers to all questions
