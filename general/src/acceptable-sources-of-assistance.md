title: "Acceptable and unacceptable sources of assistance on your assignments"
---

This policy was written by Steve Simon on 2026-01-07.

As a general rule, you cannot ask another human (a fellow student, a friend, or a co-worker) to do your work for you, but you can ask for their assistance once you have a completed draft of your work.

At any time, you can use a variety of non-human resources:

For all assignments, there are a multitude of non-human resources that you can draw on:

-   the book recommended for this class,
-   the recorded videos from the lectures,
-   slides and speaker notes from the lectures,
-   help files from your statistical software,
-   any resource discovered through an Internet search,
-   grammar and spell checkers,
-   plagiarism reviews

Use of generative AI (such as Chat GPT or Gemini), is okay with restrictions. In general, you can use these systems to small pieces of your work, but not the entire assignment. Do not ask them to prepare a report, for example, on the ethical issues associated with placebo controlled trials, and turn that in as your own work. It is okay, however, to ask for help in defining "equipoise" and including that definition in your report. The boundary between these two examples if unclear and you can always check with your instructors about any borderline issues.

If you use generative AI, please acknowledge the source somewhere in your assignment. Acknowledgement of other sources, particular peer-reviewed publications and web pages, may also be appropriate. 

Some assignments may require a formal bibliograhy and a standard citation format. You will find clear instructions on assignments where such formalities are required. In assignments without these instructions, any reasonable approach to acknowledging your sources is acceptable.

Always remember that we love working with students individually. It's one of the best parts of our job. Don't be shy in asking for help.

## Programming assignments

You are expected to write your own programs. Do not ask another human being to write your programs for you. 

You can use code snippets that you find on the help files, on a website, or through a generative AI prompt. It is not required, but a good programming practice is to acknowledge the source of any code that you rely heavily on.

If you don't know how to start writing your program, show up at one of the help sessions, or seek help from your instructors. Do not ask anyone else to write code for you.

If your program has a bug (it displays an error message or produces clearly invalid results), try your best to fix it yourself. If you continue to have problems, you are welcome to share your code with others (fellow classmates, co-workers, friends) and ask for help in fixing the bug. 

If you have a bug that you can't fix, you can also ask your instructors for help. Send both the code and the output produced by your code (if any) as an attachment. Briefly describe in your email message what you were trying to accomplish with your code.

## Oral presentations

Your presentation should rely on slide shows prepared by software like Microsoft PowerPoint or Apple Keynote. You must prepare these slides yourself. Do not ask another person to prepare your slides for you. Do not ask generative AI to prepare your entire slide show, but you can ask for help on a limited number of slides. Please acknowledge generative AI on any slide that it assists with. This is best done through a brief note at the bottom of the slide.

Once you have completed a full draft of your slide presentation, you can ask anyone to review your work and offer suggestions.

If you use images in your presentation, acknowledge the source, either as a brief footnote on the slide itself or on an "Acknowledgements" slide that appears just before your final summary slide.

If the content of a particular slide relies on a peer-reviewed publication, or if you draw a direct quote from a peer-reviewed publication, acknowledge that publication with a brief footnote listing the last name only of the first author only, along with the year of publication and the abbreviated form of the journal. 

For example, "Wilson 2023 Environ Res" is a reasonable abbreviation for "Wilson NJ, Friedman E, Kennedy K, Manolakos PT, Reierson L, Roberts A, Simon S. Using exterior housing conditions to predict elevated pediatric blood lead levels. Environmental Research. 2023 Feb 1;218:114944. doi: 10.1016/j.envres.2022.114944." 

Do not include a bibliography of all your references in your slide presentation.

## Written reports

You will be asked in some written reports for some of your classes to follow the format recommended for UMKC theses and dissertations. This is mostly for MEDB 5510, Clinical Research Methodology, and is not generally required in other classes. See the resources listed on the [School of Graduate Studies format review page][thesis] for guidance on this format.

[thesis]: https://sgs.umkc.edu/current-students/theses-and-dissertations.html

Use this format only if it specifically required and stated clearly in the assignment.

You should write any report yourself. Do not ask generative AI to produce your entire report, but you can ask for its help for small sections of your report. Please be sure to acknowledge this assistance.

You can show the report, after it is finished, to a friend, co-worker, or fellow student for suggestions on how to improve it prior to submission. You can also share a finished draft with one of your instructors prior to submission, but don't expect them to notice every problem. We only have time to provide a cursory review prior to submission.

You can also submit your report to any software system to check for grammar, to identify possible sources of plagiarism, or for any other purpose other than a wholesale revision of your work. Again, please acknowledge any system that you have used.

If your report includes a bibliography (not all reports will require this), please use a well-known formatting standard such as APA or MLA.

If you are unsure how to start your report, talk to one of your instructors.

## Summary

-   You have to write the first draft of any assignment.
-   There are many non-human resources that you can draw on at any stage. 
-   Othe humans cannot do your work for you, but they can review the work you have done.
-   You can use generative AI resources to assist with small parts of your assignment, but not the entire assignment.
-   Be sure to acknowledge any resources that you have found very helpful.
-   Your instructors are always available to provide help and guidance.
