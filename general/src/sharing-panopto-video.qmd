## Introduction

It is relatively easy to create a video for this class, but if you have never done it before, here are some detailed instructions. Your system might be different, of course, but I hope this is close enough to be of help. If you have problems, let me know.

There are other approaches that work. A simple alternative is to set up a Zoom session just for you, share your screen, and start recording. When you are done, end the Zoom session and Zoom will create and store a video (mp4) file. Follow the steps on the last slide to upload your video and create a link that you can submit on Canvas.

## Step 01, click on the `Panopto Video` link in Canvas

## Other approaches

If you recorded your talk on a different system than Panopto, that's okay. Just drag and drop your video file onto the `Panopto Video` page and then follow steps 15 through 18.
