## Grading rubric: general requirements.

Your submissions will be evaluated on three criteria:

-   Readability
-   Conciseness
-   Accuracy

Other classes have broader standards with respect to documentation, interpretations, graphs, and tables. These are very important in other programming classes, but will not be applicable to most of your SQL assignments.

## Your code must be easy to read

-   Make liberal use of
    -  blank lines
    -  line breaks
    -  indenting
    -  vertical lists

Your instructors will strive to create readable code in their classroom examples. Try to use these as models for your code, but you do not have to follow these too rigorously. Any reasonable attempt to make your code readable is fine.

## Be concise

-   Any printouts of data should have limits
    -   No more than ten records (rows)
    -   No more than five fields (variables)
        
This a rough guide and it is okay to exceed these to a small extent. In addition, some assignment may require lengthier outputs. For these assignments, the requirement for conciseness will be explicitly waived.

## Grading rubric for a twenty point assignment

-   Six points for readability
-   Two points for conciseness
-   Twelve points for accuracy

If an assignment has a different point total, these individual items will be adjusted proportionately.

## Readability

-   Poor (0 points) Two or major problems with readability
-   Fair (3 points) Three minor or one major readability issues
-   Good (6 points) Code is very easy to read

## Conciseness

-   Poor (0 points) Tables include too many records or fields
-   Good (2 points) Tables are not excessively large
    -   Ten records and five fields is a rough guide

## Accuracy

-   How accurate was your work?    
    -   Poor (0 points): Three or more major errors or omissions
    -   Fair (4 points): Two major or four minor errors or omissions
    -   Good (8 points): One major or two minor errors or omissions
    -   Excellent (12 points): Complete and accurate answers to all questions
