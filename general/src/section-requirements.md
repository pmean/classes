There are multiple sections for students in 

-   MEDB 5501, Applied Biostatistics I
-   MEDB 5502, Applied Biostatistics II
-   MEDB 5510, Clinical Research Methodology

Here are the requirements for the different sections.

## Synchronous Zoom section

You will attend a Zoom session every week. Attendance will be taken. If work or personal commitments prevent you from attending on a particular week, please notify me by email and watch the recorded videos instead. If you expect that you will not be able to attend the Zoom sessions on most weeks, please consider switching to the asynchronous section.

## Asynchronous Zoom section

Students will watch recorded videos (available 24 hours after the every Wednesday by noon). These are recordings of the weekly Zoom sessions. These videos will be available 24 hours after the synchronous Zoom classes.

## In person attendance

This option is intended for international students who have an in-person requirement for their classes. You will attend a Zoom session every week. In addition, you will sign in weekly on an attendance sheet kept at Ricardo Moniz's desk (Bioinformatics Suite, fifth floor of the School of Medicine Building). If work or personal commitments prevent you from attending on a particular week, please notify me by email and watch the recorded videos instead. 

## Some things stay the same for all three sections

If you are in any of the three sections, you will 

-   use the same Canvas site, 
-   take the same quizzes,
-   turn in the same assignments,
-   get help during the help sessions

Even if you are not in the synchronous Zoom session, you can

-   attend any or all of the synchronous Zoom sessions,
-   ask questions during these sessions.

No matter what section you are in, you can review parts or all of the asynchronous recordings for any week. 

## If you are not sure whether to enroll in the synchronous or asynchronous section

If you haven't enrolled yet and want to know which section is best, here are some considerations

-   If you have work commitments that may interfere with regular attendance, sign up for the asynchronous section
-   if you want the opportunity to ask questions during the lectures, sign up for the synchronous section

## Summary

-   You have to write the first draft of any assignment.
-   There are many non-human resources that you can draw on at any stage. 
-   Othe humans cannot do your work for you, but they can review the work you have done.
-   You can use generative AI resources to assist with small parts of your assignment, but not the entire assignment.
-   Be sure to acknowledge any resources that you have found very helpful.
-   Your instructors are always available to provide help and guidance.
