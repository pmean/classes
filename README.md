# classes

This repository includes files that I use in teaching a range of classes. Most of the files are in Markdown (.md) or R Markdown (.Rmd) format. You should have version 4.0 or later of the R programming language. R Studio is highly recommended. Some of the R Markdown files may need additional R libraries. For more information about an individual class, please consult the readme file in the appropriate folder.
