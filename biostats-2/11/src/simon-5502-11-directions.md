## General directions

Use the dataset, [arthritis-treatments.txt][ref-oa], found on my github site. Refer to the [data dictionary][ref-oa-dd] if needed. You may find it helpful to adapt some of the code from [simon-5502-11-demo.qmd][ref03].

## Question 1

You will not be graded on this, but get in the habit of drawing a few graphs and computing a few statistics that will help you better understand the dataset you are working with. Only examine variables that will be part of the further analyses.

## Question 2

Select the pain variables (those ending in VAS) and pivot the data to a wider format. Include a glimpse of the original data and the pivoted data to show that the restructuring was done properly. The original dataset should have 10 rows and 4 columns (after removing the range of motion measurements). The restructured dataset should have 30 rows and 3 columns.

## Question 3

Draw a line graph. Do the data show a consistent pattern (e.g., patients with large values on one measurement tend to have large values on the other measurements)?

## Question 4

Fit a mixed model with pain score (vas) as the dependent variable, treatment as the independent variable, and Subject as a random effect. Interpret the fixed effects. Are the t-statistics for TENS and SWD close enough to zero to conclude that there is no effect of the two treatments on pain, compared to the control group?

## Question 5

Calculate the intraclass correlation. It is very small. What does this tell you?
