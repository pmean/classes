## Third subset

-   Only group 1
-   Only males (three per litter)
-   Litter is a random factor
    -   Represents a sample from a larger population
    -   Intent to generalize to that population

## Partial listing of subset

## Variance components, 1 of 2

## Variance components, 2 of 2

::: notes
The F-ratio is 3.945/0.770 = `r round(3.945/0.770, 1)`

The intraclass correlation is 1.058/(1.058+0.770) = `r round(1.058/(1.058+0.770), 2)`
