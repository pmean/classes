## Analysis of full dataset

-   Random factor
    -   Litter
-   Fixed factors
    -   Sex
        -   Within litter comparison
    -   Group
        -   Between litter comparison
        
## Variance components, 1 of 2

::: notes
The F-ratios are 23.426/1.077 = `r `round(23.426/1.077, 1)` and 33.184/12.046 = `r round(33.184/12.046, 1)`.

The intraclass correlation is 1.828/(1.828+1.077) = `r round(1.828/(1.828+1.077), 2)`.
