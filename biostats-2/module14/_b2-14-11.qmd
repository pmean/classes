## Module 11, Hierarchical models

-   Clustered data
-   Between and within cluster variation
    -   Intraclass correlation

## Module 11, Checking assumptions

-   Independence
    -   Only between clusters
-   Normality
    -   Within clusters
    -   Between clusters
    
## Variance components, 1 of 2

## Variance components, 2 of 2

::: notes
The F-ratios are 23.426/1.077 = `r `round(23.426/1.077, 1)` and 33.184/12.046 = `r round(33.184/12.046, 1)`.

The intraclass correlation is 1.828/(1.828+1.077) = `r round(1.828/(1.828+1.077), 2)`.
