::: notes
This table shows how there is one observation for each combination of month and moon phase.

## Module 04, SPSS analysis of variance table

![](../module04/images/full-moon-analysis-17.png)

::: notes
THis is the analysis of variance table. There is one less degree of freedom than the number of categories for each categorical predictor variable. There is a statistically significant difference between the twelve months and a borderline significant difference between the three moon phases.

This differs from the single factor analysis of variance because adding in month as a categorical predictor removed a lot of variation. You are now able to account for almost 80% of the variation in admission rates. Without month in the model, you accounted for less than 7% of the variation.

::: notes
The rows corresponding to the intercept and the total (uncorrected total) are not needed.

## Module 04, SPSS parameter estimates

![](../module04/images/full-moon-analysis-19.png)

::: notes
The intercept represents the average admission rate during a full moon when the month is September. The two slope terms show how much lower the average admission rates are before and after a full moon, respectively, compared to during a full moon, holding month constant.

## Module 04, SPSS Tukey test

![](../module04/images/full-moon-analysis-20.png)

![](../module04/images/full-moon-analysis-21.png)

::: notes
Use the Tukey posthoc test because the sample sizes are equal across the moon phases. The results are a bit ambiguous because before and after are not statistically different, after and during are not statistically different but before and during are statistically different. This is probably due to a lack of precision and an extra year's worth of data would help quite a bit.

The analogy I use is travel time. My wife and I live in Leawood. Our son lives in Lee's Summit. A repair shop we all use is in Olathe. It is not far from Leawood to Olathe. It is not far from Leawood to Lee's Summit. But it is far from Lee's Summit to Olathe.

::: notes
The residuals from the full moon analysis of variance model appear to be normally distributed.

## Module 04, SPSS, Box plots of exercise data

![](../module04/images/exercise-analysis-01.png)

::: notes
Here is a clustered boxplot of weight loss in a study of two exercise interventions: jogging and swimming, and a control intervention, reading. This study shows a clear interaction between gender and exercise. Both jogging and swimming provide greater weight loss than reading (no big surprise). Swimming appears to be better than jogging. But it is a lot better for females and only a little bit better for males.
:::

## Module 04, SPSS, Mean values for the interaction

![](../module04/images/exercise-analysis-02.png)

::: notes
In this table of means, notice that men lose about 11 pounds on the jogging program, and 22 pounds on the swimming program. So swimming is better. For women, the losses are about 4 pounds on average with jogging and 30 pounds on swimming. The extra benefits of swimming are so much larger in females than in males.

## Module 04, SPSS, Analysis of variance table for interaction model

![](../module04/images/exercise-analysis-03.png)

::: notes
The analysis of variance table shows a large F ratio for the interaction between exercise program and sex.
:::

## Module 04, SPSS, Parameter estimates for the interaction model

![](../module04/images/exercise-analysis-04.png)

::: notes
The intercept is the estimated average weight loss when all the indicator variables are equal to zero. That means the two reference categories: females for gender and reading for the exercise group. If you join a book club expect to gain more than three pounds.

The estimate for female=0 is the how much different the weight loss is in the reading group when you change gender from female to male. It's a small change and not statistically significant. 

The estimate for group=1 measures how much difference you see in the average weight loss in the jogging program compared to the reading program in the reference category (female). There is almost an 8 pound difference and this is statistically significant.

The estimate for group=2 measures how much difference you see in the average weight loss in the swimming program compared to the reading program in the reference category (female). There is an astounding 32 plus pound difference between swimming and reading, but again for the reference category of females.

The estimate for female=0*prog=1 shows how much different the benefit of jogging over reading is for men compared to women. Men did pretty well on the jogging program, losing 11 pounds instead of gaining more than 3 pounds. This is more impressive than for women who lost 4 pounds instead of gaining 3. 

The estimate for female=0*prog=2 shows how much different the benefit of swimming is for men than for women. Both groups are better off swimming than reading, men losing 22 pounds versus a 3 pound gain. But the falls short of the benefit of swimming over reading for women a 29 pound loss versus a 3 pound gain.

Both of the parameters associated with the interaction are statistically significant.

Bottom line is that the benefits of jogging over reading and the benefits of swimming over reading are not the same for men and women.

## Module 04, SPSS, Interaction plot, 1 of 2

![](../module04/images/exercise-analysis-11.png)

::: notes
An interaction plot draws a multiple lines connecting means. In this graph the top line shows the mean weight loss in the swimming program with the men's mean on the left and the women's mean on the right. The middle line shows the mean weight loss in the jogging program, again with the men's mean on the left and the women's on the right. The bottom line shows the mean weight loss (actually a weight gain!) in the reading program. Clearly the swimming program is the best, a bit better for women than men because the line slopes upward. The jogging program is second best, a bit worse for women than for men. The reading program is worst and the benefit, if you could call it that being about the same for men and women (the lines are flat).

It is a lack of parallelism that is the hallmark of an interaction.
:::

## Module 04, SPSS, Interaction plot, 2 of 2

![](../module04/images/exercise-analysis-12.png)

::: notes
You could draw the interaction plot differently with a line for women (red) and a line for men (blue). The interpretation is about the same, perhaps, but the emphasis is different. The superior weight loss for men in the jogging program and the superior weight loss for women in the swimming program is emphasized by the crossing lines. Both the men's and womens lines almost touching for the reading program emphasizes the equivalent results for the two genders.

Which plot is better? I like the first one, but would not complain if you liked the second one better. It depends on what story you want to emphasize. The first graph emphasizes the difference between the diets a bit more strongly and the second emphasizes the differences between the genders a bit more strongly.

## Module 04, When you can't estimate an interaction

-   Special case, n=1
    -   Only one observation for categorical combination
    
::: notes
There is a special case where you have two categorical independent variables and you cannot estimate an interaction. If you have n=1, exactly one observation for each combination of your two categorical variables, then you don't have enough degrees of freedom to estimate an interaction and still be able to test whether that interaction is statistically significant.

It's sort of like that old joke I told about married life (it's okay but you lose a degree of freedom). Interactions cause an even bigger loss of degrees of freedom and in the case with only one observation per combination of categories, you lose enough degrees of freedom that it is not marriage, it being in prison.
:::

## Module 04, SPSS, Example, full moon study, 1 of 2

![](../module04/images/full-moon-analysis-16.png)

::: notes
Here is an example where you only have one observation for each combination of categories. 
:::

## Module 04, SPSS, Example, full moon study, 2 of 2

![](../module04/images/full-moon-analysis-24.png)

::: notes
You lose two degrees of freedom for moon (3 phases: before, during, and after). You lose 11 degrees of freedom for month (12 months -1). The interaction has 2 times 11 or 22 degrees of freedom. You only started with 35 degrees of freedom. Subtract 2, 11, and 22, and you are left with zero degrees of freedom for error.

If you find yourself in this situation, just state that no test for interaction was possible in your methods section and highlight this as a weakness of your study in the discussion section.

## Module 04, SPSS, Interaction between exercise program and hours spent exercising

![](../module04/images/exercise-analysis-05.png)

::: notes
This plot shows a marked interaction. If you looked just at prog 1 (jogging program) and prog 2 (swimming program), there is no interaction. The more hours you spent on the program the more weight you lost.

The reading program, however, has a different slope. Instead of increasing steadily, the more time you spent reading the less weight that you lost. You might even gain some weight if you followed the reading program religiously.

## Module 04, SPSS, Testing for interaction in analysis of covariance

![](../module04/images/exercise-analysis-06.png)

::: notes
This table shows a statistically significant interaction. The F ratio is large and the p-value is small.

## Module 04, SPSS, Table with irrelevant rows removed

![](../module04/images/exercise-analysis-07.png)

::: notes
Remove the rows associated with the intercept and the (uncorrected) total.
:::

## Module 04, SPSS, Parameter estimates

![](../module04/images/exercise-analysis-08.png)

```{r}
b0 <- 2.216
b1 <- -8.997
b2 <- 9.993
b3 <- -2.956
b4 <- 10.409
b5 <- 9.830
```

-   Intercept for prog=1, `r b1` + `r b0` = `r b1+b0`
-   Intercept for prog=2, `r b2` + `r b0` = `r b2+b0`
-   Intercept for prog=3, `r b0`
-   Slope for prog=1, `r b4` + `r b3` = `r b4+b3`
-   Slope for prog=2, `r b5` + `r b3` = `r b5+b3`
-   Slope for prog=3, `r b3`


::: notes
The first three coefficients are a bit of an extrapolation because they represent patients who spend zero hours on the proposed intervention.

The intercept is the estimated average weight loss in the reference category (group=3 or reading program) when the number of hours devoted to the program is zero. In this case it is a weight gain of 2 pounds.

The coefficient for group=1 is how much better the weight loss is when you switch from the reading program to the jogging program, but still put in zero hours.

The coefficient for group=2 is how much better the weight loss is on average when you switch from the reading program to the jogging program, but still put in zero hours.

The coefficient for hours is how much better the weight loss is when you add an extra hour of effort and you are in the reading program. Actually, it is how much worse. Each extra hour of reading and you gain an extra three pounds on average.

The coefficient for hours*group=1 shows the change in slope when you switch from the reading program to the jogging program. Each hour invested is 10 pounds better (a loss of 7 pounds per hour invested instead of a gain of 3 pounds per hour invested) when you switch from the reading program to the jogging program.

The interpretation for hours*group=2 is similar It shows the change in slope when you switch from the reading program to the swimming program. Each hour invested is 10 pounds better (a loss of 7 pounds per hour invested instead of a gain of 3 pounds per hour invested) when you switch from the reading program to the swimming program.
