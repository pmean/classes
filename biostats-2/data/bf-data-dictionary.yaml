description:
  This data comes from a research study done at Children's Mercy Hospital
  and St. Luke's Medical Center. This was a study of breast feeding in 
  pre-term infants. Infants were randomized into either a treatment group
  (NG tube) or a control group (Bottle). Infants in the NG tube group were
  fed in the hospital via their nasogastral tube when the mother was not
  available for breast feeding. Infants in the bottle group received
  bottles when the mothers were not available. Both groups were monitored
  for six months after discharge from the hospital
