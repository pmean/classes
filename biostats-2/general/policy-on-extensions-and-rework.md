This policy was written on 2023-12-02 and last revised on 2023-12-21.

## Extensions

Please try your best to finish all your programming assignments on time. If you need a short extension of the deadline (up to five days), just submit a file briefly explaining the circumstances that require an extension and submit it on Canvas in PDF format in the same location where you would submit your homework. Include the proposed date that you will turn in your work. A sample document might read.

*Please grant me an extension on programming assignment 03. I have been on travel at a research conference. I will turn in the programming assignment on February 3, 2024.* 

These extensions will be automatic unless circumstances change. If one or more students abuse the request for extensions, I reserve the right to modify this policy for that student, or for the entire class.

## Longer extensions

It is important to keep the class concurrent. If some students are several weeks behind the rest of the class, the concurrent comments on the discussion board lose their value and the review sessions tend to lose focus. If you really need an extension of more than five days, please send a request by email to the both instructors. If you find yourself repeatedly needing lengthy extensions for your work, a video conference with your instructor may be helpful.

## Extensions near the end of the semester

Starting on 15th week of class (April 29, 2024), you can no longer receive automatic extensions. Short extensions may be available for a limited number of students, but you must get permission from one of your instructors first. We have deadlines for reporting grades and are not given an extension on that deadline. 
## Rework

If you perform poorly on any programming assignment (less than 80% of the total points), you may choose to revise and resubmit your assignment. Please notify your instructor and grader if you plan to do this.

If you have successfully completed the assignment in the resubmission, you can earn back up to 80% of the point total (e.g, 8 points on a 10 point assignment).

## If you do not understand why you lost points

If you do not understand why you lost one or more points on an assignment, you should contact one of the instructors with an inquiry asking for clarification.

Hopefully it will be infrequent, but there may be times when a poorly written assignment may be at fault and your instructors will certainly consider changing your grade if this is the case. This should only occur if there is a serious problem with the assignment.

## Review sessions

Your instructors will hold review sessions via Zoom twice every week: Mondays from 12:30 to 1:30pm and Fridays from 10:30 to 11:30am. You can also schedule appointments with either instructor if you have questions.

## Deadlines

Assignments for one module will be due at 11:59pm on the beginning of the following week. The first week's due dates, for example, will be on the beginning of the second week of class (Monday, January 22, 2024).
