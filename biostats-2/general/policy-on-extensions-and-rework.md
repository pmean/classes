This policy was written on 2023-12-02 and last revised on 2023-12-02.

## Extensions

Please try your best to finish all your programming assignments on time. If you need a short extension of the deadline (up to five days), just submit a file briefly explaining the circumstances that require an extension and submit it on Canvas in PDF format in the same location where you would submit your homework. Include the proposed date that you will turn in your work. A sample document might read.

*Please grant me an extension on programming assignment 03. I have been on travel at a research conference. I will turn in the programming assignment on February 3, 2024.* 

These extensions will be automatic unless circumstances change. If one or more students abuse the request for extensions, I reserve the right to modify this policy for that student, or for the entire class.

Near the end of the semester, no extensions will be granted for any reason. Your instructor has deadlines for reporting grades and is not given an extension on that deadline. This would affect the programming assignments as well as any quizzes or other assignments due during during the last two weeks of class.

## Longer extensions

It is important to keep the class concurrent. If some students are several weeks behind the rest of the class, the concurrent comments on the discussion board lose their value and the review sessions tend to lose focus. If you really need an extension of more than five days, please send a request by email to the instructor and the grader. If you find yourself repeatedly needing lengthy extensions for your work, a video conference with your instructor may be helpful.

## Rework

If you perform poorly on any programming assignment (less than 80% of the total points), you may choose to revise and resubmit your assignment. Please notify your instructor and grader if you plan to do this.

If you have successfully completed the assignment in the resubmission, you can earn back up to 80% of the point total (e.g, 8 points on a 10 point assignment).

## If you do not understand why you lost points

If you do not understand why you lost one or more points on an assignment, you should contact the instructor (not the grader) with an inquiry asking for clarification.

Hopefully it will be infrequent, but there may be times when a poorly written programming assignment may be at fault and your instructor will certainly consider changing your grade if this is the case. This should only occur if there is a serious problem with the assignment.
