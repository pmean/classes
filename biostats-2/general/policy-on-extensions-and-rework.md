## Extensions

$${\color{red}Red}$$

Please try your best to finish all your programming assignments on time. If you need a short extension of the deadline (up to seven days), just submit a file briefly explaining the circumstances that require an extension and submit it on Canvas in PDF format in the same location where you would submit your homework. Include the proposed date that you will turn in your work. A sample document might read.

*Please grant me an extension on programming assignment 03. I have been on travel at a research conference. I will turn in the programming assignment on February 3, 2024.* 

The same policy on extensions applies for any special projects.

**These extensions will be automatic unless circumstances change. If one or more students abuse the request for extensions, I reserve the right to modify this policy for that student, or for the entire class.**

There are no automatic extensions for the final exam. Your instructors have a hard deadline for turning in grades and cannot get an extension ourselves. A limited number of very short extensions on the final exam may be possible, but please ask for this in advance.

You do not need to request extensions for discussion boards, quizzes, proposed final exam questions. Please do not abuse this and try your best to turn in your work without excessive delays.

## Longer extensions

It is important to keep the class concurrent. If some students are several weeks behind the rest of the class, the concurrent comments on the discussion board lose their value and the review sessions tend to lose focus. If you really need an extension of more than seven days, please send a request by email to both instructors. If you find yourself repeatedly needing lengthy extensions for your work, a video conference with your instructor may be helpful.

## Ask for extensions prior to the due date

Please ask for an extension prior to the due date. This is very important. You can ask for an extension after the due date, but it makes it harder for us to track overall student progression in the class.

## Extensions near the end of the semester

Starting on 15th week of class (April 29, 2024), you can no longer receive automatic extensions. Short extensions may be available for a limited number of students, but you must get permission from one of your instructors first. We have deadlines for reporting grades and are not given an extension on that deadline.

## If you are falling behind

Sometimes work or personal circumstances will interfere with your ability to turn work in on time for more than just one or two modules. If you are missing multiple assignments, we will try to contact you. Nevertheless, it is **your** responsibility to contact **us** if you are falling behind. We can usually work out a solution if you talk to us.

## Grading for extensions

To help your instructors track progress in this class, we will assign a zero temporarily to any late assignment, even one that you have received an extension on. Once you have turned in a late assignment, we will update the score.

## Rework

If you perform poorly on any programming assignment (less than 80% of the total points), you may choose to revise and resubmit your assignment. Please notify your instructor and grader if you plan to do this.

If you have successfully completed the assignment in the resubmission, you can earn back up to 80% of the point total (e.g, 8 points on a 10 point assignment).

You only get one shot on the quizzes so read each question carefully, especially true/false questions. You cannot ask to retake a quiz. Save information about the questions you got wrong, because you will probably see similar questions on the final exam.

## If you do not understand why you lost points

If you do not understand why you lost one or more points on an assignment, you should contact one of the instructors with an inquiry asking for clarification.

Hopefully it will be infrequent, but there may be times when a poorly written assignment may be at fault and your instructors will certainly consider changing your grade if this is the case. This should only occur if there is a serious problem with the assignment.

## Help with your homework

Your instructors will hold review sessions via Zoom twice every week: Mondays from 12:30 to 1:30pm and Fridays from 10:30 to 11:30am. Many students will show up at these review sessions without any questions but with the hope that they may learn something from other student questions. This is perfectly fine. You can also ask questions that are outside the scope of the class once all the questions directly related to the lectures or programming assignments are finished.

You can also schedule appointments with either instructor if you have questions.

We love talking with students. It's one of the best parts of our job. Don't be shy in asking for help.
