title: General grading rubric
---
This file was written by Steve Simon on 2023-08-15. It is in the public domain and you can use it any way you please. This is adapted from a grading rubric used in my Introduction to SAS class.

### General requirements.

**Filename**. You must submit your homework as a single PDF file (preferred) or as several separate PDF files. The name of the file you submit must include

-   your last name, 
-   class number, and 
-   module number
    -   For example, simon-5502-module01-homework.pdf.

**Documentation**. You must include a documentation header at or near the top of every programming assignment. Your documentation header must include

-   the name of the author (you!),
-   the creation date, 
-   the purpose of your program, and 
-   any restrictions on use.

You can choose to place your program in the public domain (no restrictions) or you can specify restrictions on how others can use your program (e.g., no commercial use). This is entirely your discretion.

**Graphs**. If the assignment requires graphs, you must modify the graphs to publication quality. This means

-   Avoiding the display of unnecessary decimal places
-   Using comma separators for large numbers
-   Including units of measurement on axis labels
-   Avoiding the use of color, unless it is needed to distinguish between groups.
    -   Use either white or transparent color to fill boxes and points.
-   Including tick marks on both axes
-   Including your name and date on the title of any graph
    -   For example, "This graph was produced by Steve Simon on 2023-09-19."

**Readability**. I am not grading on the readability of your code. Nevertheless, if you use a program other than SPSS, I strongly encourage you to use line breaks, indents, and vertical lists to make your code more readable.

### Grading rubric

This grading rubric is for an assignment worth 10 points. Change these numbers proportionately for an assignment worth a different number of points (e.g, triple all the point values for an assignment worth 30 points).

-   How well did you follow the general requirements specified above?
    -    Poor (0 points) Complete failure to address two or more of the required elements (filename, documentation, or graphs).
    -    Fair (2 points) Complete failure to address one of the required elements or missing two or more parts of a required element.
    -    Good (4 points) Includes all required elements

-   How accurate was your work?    
    -   Poor (0 points): Three or more major errors or omissions
    -   Fair (2 points): Two major errors or omissions
    -   Good (4 points): Two minor errors or one major error or omission
    -   Excellent (6 points): Complete and accurate answers to all questions
