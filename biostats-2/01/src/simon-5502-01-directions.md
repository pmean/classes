This assignment is for practice only and there is no grading.

## Program

-   Write this program on your own using examples from the previous semester.

## Question 1

Calculate descriptive statistics for the three variables in the dataset. 
Interpret these statistics. You do not need to produce any graphs.

## Question 2

Calculate a linear regression model using Load as the independent variable and
Velocity as the dependent variable. Interpret these resutls.descriptive statistics for sleep (mean, standard deviation, and 
sample size) by the combination of the two categorical predictors, partners and
type. Is there evidence of heterogeneity?

## Question 3

Calculate indicator variables for Tree=2 and Tree=3. Include these as 
independent variables in a linear regression model predicting Velocity.
Interpret this model.
