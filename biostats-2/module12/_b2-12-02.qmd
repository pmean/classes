## Description of hiv-intervention data, 1 of 2

```{r}
library(yaml)
dd <- read_yaml("../../../datasets/hiv-intervention.yaml")
cat(as.yaml(dd["data_dictionary"]))
cat(as.yaml(dd["source"]))
cat(as.yaml(dd["description"]))
```

::: notes
Here is a dataset I will use to illustrate the random intercepts model. It actually might require a more sophisticated model than the random intercepts, but it is always a good idea to start with the simplest model, even if you know it is an oversimplification. Slowly add layers of complexity, and don't fit the final model too early. You want to wade in from the shallow end of the pool rather than jump right away into the deep end.

## Description of hiv-intervention data, 2 of 2

```{r}
cat(as.yaml(dd$vars[1:5]))
```

::: notes
Here are the first three variables. The actual times associated with the Pre and Post measurements are unclear. It turns out that it will be best to hold the Pre measurement back for the time being and start the clock at time=0 for the Post measurement. Remember that you are wading in from the shallow end of the pool.

The remaining two variables FU6 and FU12 represent time=6 and time=12, respectively.
