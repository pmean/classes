## Interactions in logistic regression

-   Odds ratios vary by a third factor
-   Interpretation is more tedious

## Odds ratios for first class

## Logistic regression with interaction

-   Odds ratio for 3rd class = 4.608
-   Odds ratio for 1st class = 4.608 $\times$ 6.572 = 30.2
-   Odds ratio for 2nd class = 4.608 $\times$ 9.289 = 42.8
