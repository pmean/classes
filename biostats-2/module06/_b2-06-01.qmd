## Comparing two binary outcomes

-   Is there a difference in the proportion of deaths between male passengers and female passengers on the Titanic?
-   Is there difference in the proportion of patients finishing the full three doses of HPV vaccine between Black women and White women?
-   Does using a ng tube for feeding in pre-term infants increase the probability of successful breast feeding at six months?

::: notes
Most of the statistics, you have seen so far involve a continuous outcome. You can, however, use a binary outcome. Here are three examples comparing a binary outcome between two groups.

## Other comparisons involving a binary outcome

-   Is there are difference in the proportion of deaths between first class, second class, and third class passengers?
-   Does age influence the proportion of women finishing the full three doses of HPV vaccine?
-   Controlling for the mother's age, does using a ng tube for feeding in pre-term infants increase the probability of successful breast feeding at six months?

::: notes
Here are some more complex comparisons involving a binary outcome. The first example involves a comparison of three proportions, not two. The next example involves a continuous predictor of a binary outcome. The final example involves a comparison of binary outcomes in two groups, but controlling for a third variable.

## Hypothesis framework

-   $H_0:\ \pi_1=\pi_2$
-   $H_1:\ \pi_1=\pi_2$
-   Compute $\hat p_1$ and $\hat p_2$ from samples
-   Accept $H_0$ if $\hat p_1-\hat p_2$ is close to zero.
    -   $T=(\hat p_1-\hat p_2)/s.e.$
    -   95% CI: $(\hat p_1-\hat p_2) \pm Z_{\alpha/2}s.e.$

::: notes
The hypothesis to test two proportions uses the symbols $\pi_1$ and $\pi_2$ to represent the proportions in a population.

## Titanic data, 1 of 3

```{r}
library(yaml)
dd <- read_yaml("../data/titanic.yaml")
cat(as.yaml(dd["data_dictionary"]))
cat(as.yaml(dd["description"]))
```

## Titanic data, 2 of 3

```{r}
cat(as.yaml(dd$vars[1:3]))
```

## Titanic data, 3 of 3

```{r}
cat(as.yaml(dd$vars[4:5]))
```

## Data layout, 1 of 2

::: notes
There are two ways to present the data to SPSS. You can have one row per patient for a total of 1,313 rows.

## Data layout, 2 of 2

::: notes
Or you could have four rows, one for each combination of sex and survival.

::: notes
Here is the output from SPSS. The confidence interval contains only positive values, so you can conclude that the difference in proportions is statistically significant.

You can draw the same conclusion from the p-value, which is less than 0.001.
