## Informal sample size calculations, 1 of 2

-   Rule of 50
    -   Need 25 to 50 events in each group
    -   Based on approximate power calculation
-   Example: newborn readmissions for jaundice
    -   Occurs about 2% (1/50) of the time
    -   Need 25 $\times$ 50=1,250 or 50 $\times$ 50=2,500 in each group
    
## Informal sample size calculations, 2 of 2

-   Rule of 15
    -   Need 15 events for each independent variable
    -   Smaller ratio implies poor replicability
    -   Note: events, not observations
    
## Formal power calculation    

## Assumptions of logistic regression

-   Independence
-   Linearity
    -   On a log odds scale
-   No assumptions about normality

## Computing probability estimates, male and 3rd class

![](images/assumptions-05.png)

```{r}
b0 <- -2.029
odds <- exp(b0)
prob <- odds/(1+odds)
```

-   log odds = `r b0`
-   odds = exp(log odds) = `r round(odds, 4)`
-   prob = odds / (1+odds) = `r round(prob, 4)`

## Computing probability estimates, male and first class

![](images/assumptions-05.png)

```{r}
b1 <-  1.319
odds <- exp(b0+b1)
prob <- odds/(1+odds)
```

-   log odds = `r b0` + `r b1`
-   odds = exp(log odds) = `r round(odds, 4)`
-   prob = odds / (1+odds) = `r round(prob, 4)`

## Computing probability estimates, male and second class

![](images/assumptions-05.png)

```{r}
b2 <-  0.25
odds <- exp(b0+b2)
prob <- odds/(1+odds)
```

-   log odds = `r b0` + `r b2`
-   odds = exp(log odds) = `r round(odds, 4)`
-   prob = odds / (1+odds) = `r round(prob, 4)`

## Computing probability estimates, female and third class

![](images/assumptions-05.png)

```{r}
b3 <-  1.528
odds <- exp(b0+b3)
prob <- odds/(1+odds)
```

-   log odds = `r b0` + `r b3`
-   odds = exp(log odds) = `r round(odds, 4)`
-   prob = odds / (1+odds) = `r round(prob, 4)`

## Computing probability estimates, female and first class

![](images/assumptions-05.png)

```{r}
b4 <- 1.883
odds <- exp(b0+b1+b3+b4)
prob <- odds/(1+odds)
```

-   log odds = `r b0` + `r b1` + `r b3` + `r b4`
-   odds = exp(log odds) = `r round(odds, 4)`
-   prob = odds / (1+odds) = `r round(prob, 4)`

## Computing probability estimates, female and second class

```{r}
b5 <- 2.229
odds <- exp(b0+b2+b3+b5)
prob <- odds/(1+odds)
```

-   log odds = `r b0` + `r b2` + `r b3` + `r b5`
-   odds = exp(log odds) = `r round(odds, 4)`
-   prob = odds / (1+odds) = `r round(prob, 4)`
