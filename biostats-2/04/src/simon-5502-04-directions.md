## Program

-   Write a program to answer the questions listed below. You may wish to adapt some code from the [demonstration program for module03][ref-5502-04-demo]. Replace my name with yours everywhere, remove the "Comments on the code" sections, and only include program chunks that address the questions listed below.

## Question 1

Create a child variable using the code you saw in class. Also create an improvement variable that calculates how much better the results in trial4 are compared to trial1. Calculate and interpret a histogram for the improvement variable.

## Question 2

Draw a line plot that examines whether there might be an interaction between child and gender in predicting improvement. You should look at the plot two different ways, but only include the one plot that you think best describes what is going on. Interpret this plot.

## Your submission

-   Save the output in html format
-   Convert it to pdf format.
-   Make sure that the pdf file includes
    -   Your last name
    -   The number of this course
    -   The number of this module
-   Upload the file

## Your grade

-   Your grade will be based on this [grading rubric][ref04]. Please also note the [policy on late submissions and rework][ref05]. If your program does not work, please review the [suggestions if you encounter an error page][ref06].
