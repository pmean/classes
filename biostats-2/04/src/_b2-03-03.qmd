## Mathematical model

-   $Y_i=\beta_0+\beta_1 X_i+\beta_2 T_i+\epsilon_i$
    -   $X_i$ is the covariate
    -   $T_i$ is an indicator variable for treatment
-   Estimate $\hat\beta_0,\ \hat\beta_1,\ \hat\beta_2$

## Interpretation, 1 of 4

-   $\hat\beta_0$
    -   estimated average value of Y
        -   when X=0, T=0

## Interpretation, 2 of 4

-   $\hat\beta_1$
    -   estimated average change in Y
        -   when X increases by one unit and 
        -   T is held constant

## Interpretation, 3 of 4

-   $\hat\beta_2$
    -   estimated average change in Y
    -   when T increases by one unit and 
    -   X is held constant

## Interpretation, 4 of 4

-   $\hat\beta_0$ is intercept for controls
-   $\hat\beta_0+\hat\beta_2$ is intercept for treatment

$\ $

-   $\hat\beta_2$ is the adjusted average difference between the treatment and the control

## Interpretation

-   The estimated average price for a regular home with zero square feet is 11 thousand dollars.
-   The adjusted average difference in price between a regular house and a custom built house holding the size of the house constant is 14 thousand dollars
-   The estimated average price increases by 55 dollars when the size increases by one square foot, holding the type of house (regular or custom build) constant.

    -   $11.413 + 14.286*0 + 0.055*1505.30 = `r 11.413 + 14.286*0 + 0.055*1505.30`$
    -   $11.413 + 14.286*1 + 0.055*2149.04 = `r 11.413 + 14.286*1 + 0.055*2149.04`$
-   Adjusted
    -   $11.413 + 14.286*0 + 0.055*1653.85 = `r 11.413 + 14.286*0 + 0.055*1653.85`$
    -   $11.413 + 14.286*1 + 0.055*1653.85 = `r 11.413 + 14.286*1 + 0.055*1653.85`$
