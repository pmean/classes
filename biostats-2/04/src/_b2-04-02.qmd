## Mathematical model, 1

-   Decompose $\mu_ij$ into $\mu + \alpha_i + \beta_j$
    -   $\alpha_i$ is the deviation for the ith level of first factor
    -   $\beta_j$ is the deviation for the jth level of second factor
    -   Require $\alpha_1=0$ and $\beta_1=0$
    -   $\mu$ is the mean for the reference levels

::: notes
The mathematical model for two factor analysis of variance is a bit more complex than a single factor analysis of variance. You have a mean at the reference levels, mu, You also have deviations from the overall mean associated with the first factor (alpha), deviations from the overall mean associated with the second factor (beta)

There are a total of a and b categories for the two categorical independent variables.

## Mathematical model, 2

-   $Y_{ijk} = \mu + \alpha_i + \beta_j +\epsilon_{ijk}$
    -   i=1,...,a levels of the first categorical variable
    -   j=1,...,b levels of the second categorical variable
    -   k=1,...,n replicates with first and second categories
-   Note: $\mu, \alpha_i, \beta_j, \epsilon_{ijk}$ are population values

You have an overall mean, mu, and deviations from the overall mean associated with the first factor (alpha), deviations from the overall mean associated with the second factor (beta) and an error term (epsilon).

## Mathematical model, 3

-   $H_0:\ \alpha_i=0$ for all i

$\ $

-   $H_0:\ \beta_j=0$ for all j

::: notes

There are two hypotheses. The first, testing that all the alphas equal zero is effectively testing whether the first factor has no impact on the outcome. Testing that all the betas equal zero is effectively testing whether the second factor has no impact on the outcome.

## Parameter estimates for the two factor model

```{r}
#| label: table-5

```

::: notes
These are the parameter estimates for the two factor analysis of variance. The reference categories are "Before" and "Aug".

The intercept represents the average admission rate before a full moon when the month is August. The two terms associates with moon show how much changes there is from before a full moon to during a full moon and from before a full moon to after a full moon, respectively. The remaining parameter estimates show how much each month differs from the first month (August).

## Analysis of variance table comparing the two factor model to the one factor model

```{r}
#| label: table-7

table_7
```

::: notes
This is the analysis of variance table. There is one less degree of freedom than the number of categories for each categorical predictor variable. There is a statistically significant difference between the twelve months and a borderline significant difference between the three moon phases.

This differs from the single factor analysis of variance because adding in month as a categorical predictor removed a lot of variation. You are now able to account for almost 80% of the variation in admission rates. Without month in the model, you accounted for less than 7% of the variation.

## Tukey post hoc test

::: notes
Use the Tukey posthoc test because the sample sizes are equal across the moon phases. The results are a bit ambiguous because before and after are not statistically different, after and during are not statistically different but before and during are statistically different. This is probably due to a lack of precision and an extra year's worth of data would help quite a bit.

The analogy I use is travel time. My wife and I live in Leawood. Our son lives in Lee's Summit. A repair shop we all use is in Olathe. It is not far from Leawood to Olathe. It is not far from Leawood to Lee's Summit. But it is far from Lee's Summit to Olathe.
