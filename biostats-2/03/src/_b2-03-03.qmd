## Mathematical model

-   $Y_i=\beta_0+\beta_1 X_i+\beta_2 T_i+\epsilon_i$
    -   $X_i$ is the covariate
    -   $T_i$ is an indicator variable for treatment
-   Estimate $\hat\beta_0,\ \hat\beta_1,\ \hat\beta_2$

## Interpretation, 1

-   $\hat\beta_0$
    -   estimated average value of Y
        -   when X=0, T=0

## Interpretation, 2

-   $\hat\beta_1$
    -   estimated average change in Y
        -   when X increases by one unit and 
        -   T is held constant

## Interpretation, 3

-   $\hat\beta_2$
    -   estimated average change in Y
    -   when T increases by one unit and 
    -   X is held constant

## Interpretation, 4

-   $\hat\beta_0$ is intercept for controls
-   $\hat\beta_0+\hat\beta_2$ is intercept for treatment

$\ $

-   $\hat\beta_2$ is the adjusted average difference between the treatment and the control
