## What is a linear combination?

-   Multiply each variable by a constant and add
-   Examples
    -   $X_1+X_2+X_3+X_4$
    -   $\frac{1}{4}X_1+\frac{1}{4}X_2+\frac{1}{4}X_3+\frac{1}{4}X_4$
    -   $\frac{1}{2}\times X_1+0  X_2+0 X_3+\frac{1}{2} X_4$
    -   $\frac{1}{3} X_1+\frac{1}{3} X_2+\frac{1}{3} X_3-1 \times X_4$
    -   $\frac{4}{10} X_1+\frac{4}{10} X_2+\frac{1}{10} X_3+\frac{1}{10} X_4$
    -   $9X_1+3X_2+5X_3-X_4$
    
::: notes
The simplest linear combination is just a sum. Multiply each variable by one and add the values together.

Almost as simple is an average. With four variables, multiply each variable by one fourth and add the values together.

A linear combination could effectively exclude one or more of the variables just by multiplying them by zero. The third linear combination is an average of just the first and last variables.

You can put negative numbers in the linear combination. The fourth linear combination computes the average of the first three variables and subtracts the last variable.

The fifth linear combination is a weighted average. The first two variables are weighted four times as much as the last two variables.

A linear combination does not necessarily have to involve averages. Taking 9 times the first variable plus 3 times the second variable plus 5 times the third variable minus the fourth variable.

## Not a linear combination?

-   $X_1 \times X_2 + X_3 + X_4$
-   $X_1^4 + X_2 + X_3 + X_4$
-   $log(X_1)+X_2+X_3+X_4$

::: notes
Multiply two or more of the variables together and it is no longer a linear combination. Raise one of the variables to a power and it is no longer a linear combination. Taking a function of one of the variables and it is no longer a linear combination.

## Practical examples

-   Apgar score is a linear combination
    -   Rate appearance, pulse, grimace response, activity, and respiration
    -   Add the values together
-   Body mass index is not a linear combination
    -   Weight divided by height squared

::: notes
Apgar score is a linear combination. Rate five features of a newborn baby on a scale of 0, 1, or 2. Then add the five values together to produce a linear combination that equals zero for a baby in extreme distress all the way to a happy baby with an apgar score of 10. Actually, the baby has to have a loud cry to get a 10, so perhaps this is more of a healthy baby than a happy baby.

Body mass index is not a linear combination. It involved division, which is just as much of a no-no as multiplication. It also involve a power of two which would also make it not a linear combination.

## Philosophy behind principal components, 1 of 4

-   Reduce complexity by modeling inter-relationships
-   Inter-relationships represented by linear combinations
    -   There is no dependent or outcome variable in principal components analysis

## Philosophy behind principal components, 2 of 4

-   First principal component
    -   Linear combination that accounts most variation
    -   This linear combination is the first eigenvector
    -   The amount of variation accounted for is the first eigenvalue

## Philosophy behind principal components, 3 of 4

-   Need to resolve an ambiguity
    -   $3X_1+5X_2-4X_3+7X_4-1X_5$ versus $6X_1+10X_2-8X_3+14X_4-2X_5$
    -   Solution: require sum of squared coefficients to equal 1
    -   Note: $3^2+5^2+(-4)^2+7^2+(-1)^2=100$
    -   Use $\frac{3}{10}X_1+\frac{5}{10}X_2-\frac{4}{10}X_3+\frac{7}{10}X_4-\frac{1}{10}X_5$

## Philosophy behind principal components, 4 of 4

-   Second principal component
    -   Linear combination that accounts second most variation
    -   Must be uncorrelated with first principal component
    -   This linear combination is the second eigenvector
    -   The amount of variation accounted for is the second eigenvalue
-   Third principal component defined similarly

## Covariance matrix or correlation matrix

-   Correlation matrix equivalent to standardizing
    -   Absolute requirement if differing units
-   Covariance matrix de-emphasizes low variance variables    

## How many components?

-   Percentage of variation accounted for
    -   Scree plot
-   Eigenvalues > 1
-   Researcher preference/convenience

## Communality

-   Amount of shared variation
    -   Always between 0 and 1
    -   Similar interpretation to R-squared
    -   "One of these things is not like the others"
    
## Factor score matrix

-   Linear combination coefficients
-   Needed if you score by hand
-   No obvious interpretation
-   First component is often only positive values

## Component matrix

-   Interpret as correlation matrix
    -   Rows are individual variables
    -   Columns are principal components

Here are a few pieces of the data dictionary for a file I will be using. I won't show the entire data dictionary, as it is quite long.
