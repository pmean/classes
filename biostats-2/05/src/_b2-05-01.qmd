## Mathematical model, 1

-   $Y_{ijk}=\mu+\alpha_i+\beta_j+(\alpha \beta)_{ij}+\epsilon_{ijk}$
    -   i=1,...,a j=1,...,b, k=1,...,n
-   If 1 is the reference category
    -   $\alpha_1=0$
    -   $\beta_1=0$
    -   $(\alpha \beta)_{1j}=0$
    -   $(\alpha \beta)_{i1}=0$

::: notes

You may see papers or books that present the mathematical model for an interaction. The model I present is a balanced model with the first category having levels one through a, the second category having levels one through b and for each combination of categories there are n observations.

If you set the first level as the reference category for each category, then you need to set some of these parameters to zero.

## Mathematical model, 2

-   $SS_A=\Sigma_i nb(\bar{Y}_{i..}-\bar{Y}_{...})^2$
-   $SS_B=\Sigma_i na(\bar{Y}_{.j.}-\bar{Y}_{...})^2$
-   $SS_{AB}=\Sigma_i \Sigma_j n(\bar{Y}_{ij.}-\bar{Y}_{i..}-\bar{Y}_{.j.}+ \bar{Y}_{...})^2$
-   $SS_E=\Sigma_i \Sigma_j \Sigma_k (Y_{ijk}-\bar{Y}_{ij.})^2$
-   $SS_T=\Sigma_i \Sigma_j \Sigma_k (Y_{ijk}-\bar{Y}_{...})^2$

::: notes

The dot notation may be a bit confusing until you get used to it, but $\bar{Y}_{i..}$ is the average within the ith group, averaging across the subscripts j and k. $\bar{Y}_{.j.}$ is the average within the ith group, averaging across the subscripts i and k. $\bar{Y}_{ij.}$ is the average within the combination of the ith group and the jth group, averaging across the subscript k. Finally, $\bar{Y}_{...}$ is an overall mean and the average across all three subscripts.

## Test for an interaction

-   $SS_{AB}$ has (a-1)(b-1) degrees of freedom
-   $SS_E$ has ab(n-1) degrees of freedom
-   Accept $H_0$ if $F=\frac{MS_{AB}}{MS_E}$ is close to one
    -   In R, fit a model without an interaction
    -   Compare to a model with interaction
    -   Using the anova function
    
::: notes

The formal test for an interaction uses an F ratio and you accept the null hypothesis if that F ratio is close to one. You would reject the null hypothesis if the F ratio is much larger than one.

It is not easy to get R to display all the sums of squares and mean squares that I defined above. Instead, compute two models-one without an interaction and one with an interaction. Compare those two models using the anova function.
