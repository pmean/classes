## Program

-   Write a program to answer the questions listed below. You may wish to adapt some code from the [demonstration program for module03][ref-5502-04-demo]. Replace my name with yours everywhere, remove the "Comments on the code" sections, and only include program chunks that address the questions listed below.

## Data

-   Download the [data][ref-tracking-txt] file
    -   Store it in your data folder
-   Refer to the [data dictionary][ref-tracking-yaml], if needed.

You should show your work from module 04 in this program including the interpretations that you made for the interaction plot.

## Question 1

Using the dataset from last week where you created a child variable and an improvement variable, conduct a formal test to see if there is an interaction between child and gender on the amount of improvement between trial1 and trial4. Interpret your results.

## Question 2

Use the factor function, if needed, to insure that child=Yes and gender=F are the two reference levels.

## Question 3

Display the estimates for the interaction model and provide a brief interpretation of whether the interaction term is super-additive/sub-additive. You could use the terms synergistic/antagonistic if you prefer.

## Your submission

-   Save the output in html format
-   Convert it to pdf format.
-   Make sure that the pdf file includes
    -   Your last name
    -   The number of this course
    -   The number of this module
-   Upload the file

## Your grade

-   Your grade will be based on this [grading rubric][ref04]. Please also note the [policy on late submissions and rework][ref05]. If your program does not work, please review the [suggestions if you encounter an error page][ref06].
