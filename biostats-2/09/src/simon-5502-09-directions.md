## General directions

Use the dataset, [glycyrrhizin.csv][ref01], found on my github site. Refer to the [data dictionary][ref02] if needed. You may find it helpful to adapt some of the code from [simon-5502-09-demo.qmd][ref03].

## Question 1

Open the comma delimited text file glycyrrhizin.csv and display the first ten rows of data. Compute the treatment_probability and control_probability and the odds ratio by hand. Provide a brief interpretation of these odds ratios.

## Question 2

Run a meta-analysis for binary outcomes. Note that there is no subgroup analysis for this particular dataset. Use the log odds ratio as the summary measure. Interpret the overall odds ratio and the tests and measures of heterogeneity.

## Question 3

Draw a forest plot. Is there evidence that the treatment is more effective than the control?  Identify the two or three studies that received the greatest weight and the two or three studies which received the least weight.

## Question 4

Draw and interpret the funnel plot.
