## Lay out the parameters

![](images/blank-sheet.png "Blank sheet listing ECMO and control probabilities")

::: notes
Here's an example of a very simple Bayesian analysis. The columns, pi1, represent the population proportion of infants on ECMO who survive. We hope that the results will be on the right hand side, but we don't know until we run the experiment.

The rows represent the population proportion of infants in the control group who survive. We'd like to see the values near the bottom rather than the top, but in a population of very premature births, this is not guaranteed.

## Place half the probability on the diagonal

![](images/main-diagonal.png "Probabilities of 0.005000 for every diagonal cell")

::: notes
We don't know if ECMO is better or worse, so let's start out by placing half the probability along the diagonal. The diagonal here represents all the cases where the survival probability on ECMO equals the survival probability in the control group. There are ten diagonal cells, so it seems fair to divide the 50% probability into ten pieces of 5% each.

## Difuse prior

![](images/off-diagonal.png "Probabilities of 0.00556 for every off-diagonal cell")

::: notes
Now spread out the remaining 50% of the probability across the remainder of the table. There are 90 cells remaining, so when you divide 50% by 90, you get 0.56%. Notice that the upper triangle gets just as much probability as the lower triangle. if the parameter were found in the upper triangle, that would represent cases where ECMO has a higher survival rate than the control group.

## Difuse prior

![](images/prior-combined.png "Diagonal and off-diagonal measurements combined into one matrix")

::: notes

Put these two together and check that the total probability is 100%. These represents your prior belief, and since this study was run before there was much research, it makes sense to spread the probability more or less evenly across the table, but also splitting the data so that the probability on the diagonal, the probability of the null hypothesis, is the same as the probability off the diagonal, the probability of the alternative hypothesis.

Now if the thought of assigning probabilities to hypotheses prior to collecting data makes you feel queasy, you are in good company. But bear with me for a moment.
