## Classical statistics, 1 of 3

-   $H_0:\ \pi_1=\pi_2$
-   $H_1:\ \pi_1 \ne \pi_2$
    -   $\pi_1$, $pi_2$ are fixed constants

::: notes
I want to illustrate the classical example of hypothesis testing. Here is the simple case of testing whether the proportion in one population is equal to the proportion in a second population.

## Classical statistics, 2 of 3

-   $T=\frac{\hat p_1-\hat p_2}{s.e.}$
-   p-value = $P[Z > T]$
    -   probability of sample results or more extreme
    -   p-value is not $P[H_0]$ 
    
::: notes
You can compute a test statistic and a p-value associated with that statistic. Although a p-value is a probability, you cannot say that the p-value equals the probability that the null hypothesis is true.

## Classical statistics, 3 of 3

-   95% confidence interval
    -   $\hat p_1-\hat p_2 \pm Z_{\alpha/2}s.e.$
    -   Range of plausible values
-   Probability statements not possible.
