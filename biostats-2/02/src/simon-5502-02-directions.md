This programming assignment was written by Steve Simon on 2025-01-27 and is 
placed in the public domain.

This assignment is for practice only and there is no grading.

## Program

-   Write this program on your own using examples from the previous semester.

## Data

-   Download the [data][ref01] file
    -   Store it in your data folder
-   Refer to the [data dictionary][ref02], if needed.

## Question 1

You will not be graded on this, but get in the habit of computing some simple statistics (mean, standard deviation, minimum, and maximum) and histograms for the important variables in this dataset (TotalSleep, BodyWt, LifeSpan, and Gestation). Also, get in the habit of providing brief interpretations.

## Question 2

Calculate a linear regression model using BodyWt as the independent variable and a second linear regression model using BodyWt, LifeSpan, and Gestation. Interpret the r-squared values for both models.

## Question 3

Test the hypothesis that LifeSpan and Gestation help in predicting TotalSleep above and beyond BodyWt.

## Question 4

Check the assumptions of normality, linearity, and homoscedascity for the model with BodyWt, LifeSpan, and Gestation as independent variables.
