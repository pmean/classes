## Your submission

Prepare a single PDF file with the results of each of these questions. Include the original questions as well as your answers.

## Question 1

Calculate the sensitivity and specificity for the overall caries results (first five rows of data from Table 2). You can calculate these by hand, inside of R, using a spreadsheet program, or any other reasonable approach.

## Question 2

Explain which paper has the best results for ruling in a diagnosis. Which paper has the best results for ruling out a diagnosis?

## Question 3

Calculate the likelihood ratio for a positive result and for a negative result the overall caries diagnosis in the Suttapak paper (third row in Table 2).

## Question 4

Prevalence of caries depends on a variety of factors. Refer to the table "Percent of Adults with Untreated Decay in the Permanent Teeth" in the report on Dental Caries (Tooth Decay). What is the overall prevalence of untreated decay in the most recent survey? What factors might cause you to increase this prevalence? Hint: look at the percentages in the various demographic groups from the same table.

## Question 5

Calculate the post-test odds and post-test probabilities if you estimate the pre-test probability as 25% and the diagnostic test in the Suttapak paper comes out positive.

## Question 6

I am not a dentist, but presume that you would only treat a patient if the post-test probability is 40% or higher. What value for the pre-test probability is so small that you would not want to use the diagnostic test proposed in the Suttapak paper? What value for the pre-test probability is so large that you would not want to use this test?
