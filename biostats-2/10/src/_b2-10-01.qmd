## Talk given to first year medical students

-   Topic also relevant to this class.
-   Only a few minor changes
    -   Different format for the "programming" assignment
    
::: notes
I like to re-use material, so this week's lecture is an adaptation of a talk I have given as a guest lecture for a special class of first year medical students.

There is no programming in this module, so I will change the homework assignment a bit.

## Who am I?

Steve Simon

-   PhD Statistics, 1982, U Iowa
-   Teach in Biomedical and Health Informatics
    -   Previous jobs at CMH, CDC
-   Part-time independent statistical consultant (P.Mean Consulting)
-   Married to a Pediatric Cardiologist (retired)
-   Run 5K and 4 mile races

::: notes
Let me introduce myself. I am Steve Simon. I got a PhD in Statistics almost 40 years ago from the University of Iowa. The world has changed a lot since then, but I have tried to keep up. Today, if you want to sound trendy, you are a "data scientist". I teach in the Department of Biomedical and Health Informatics at UMKC. I have had previous jobs at Children's mercy Hospital, and the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. I'm also a part-time statistical consultant. I have a sole proprietorship, P.Mean Consulting. That's short for Professor Mean. For people who don't get the joke, I point out that Professor Mean is not just your average Professor. Related to this talk, I should point out that I am obsessed with computers.

## Obsessed with computers since 1972

::: notes

I should add that I am a bit of a computer geek. Here's a list of computer skills that I put on my resume. I deliberately made this too small to read so that you wouldn't recognize that half of the computer skills I mention have been obsolete for several deades. The computers I used in the 1970s were nothing like today's computers.

## Worked with health care applications since 1987

-   Recent positions
    -   Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (1987-1996)
    -   Children's Mercy Hospital (1996-2008)
    -   UMKC School of Medicine (2008 to present)
-   But...
    -   I am not a doctor
    -   Still confused about many things
        -   Example: Difference between good and bad cholesterol.
  
::: notes

I've also been working with a variety of health care professionals for many decades. I have learned a lot along the way, but I am not a doctor. Not an MD doctor anyway. When I talk about medical examples, keep that in mind. I don't always describe things accurately from a medical perspective, and I'm always forgetting which one is the bad cholesterol.

Is it ldl or hdl? Does anyone know?

## Quiz questions (1/3)

Why does Joel Best call statistics a social construct?

-   Statistics are misquoted often on social media.
-   Statistics are selected, shaped, and presented by human beings.
-   Statistics are used to promote socialism.
-   Statistics are dehumanizing.

::: notes

I want to list a few quiz questions relating to this lecture. Remember these questions when I get to the slide that discusses them.

## Quiz questions (2/3)

What is the main philosophical foundation of empiricism?

-   Everything can be reduced to a mathematical equation.
-   Experiments can reveal the realities of the world.
-   Some questions are impossible to answer.
-   We construct our own reality based on our own lived experiences

::: notes

Here's the second question.

## Quiz questions (3/3)

What is a major problem with data science?

-   Data scientists rely on large amounts of data with uneven quality.
-   Models developed by data scientists can lead to loss of privacy.
-   Prediction models are a black box that can hide discriminatory intent.
-   All of the above.

::: notes

Here's the third question. You don't need to answer these questions now. Just be ready to answer them after the lecture.

## First poll question

![Figure 2. Quote from "Peggy Sue Got Married"](http://www.pmean.com/new-images/21/dark-side-01.png)

::: notes

I want to get a quick feel for your background and interests. Here's a quote from a romantic comedy starring Kathleen Turner from 1986. A forty year old woman, played by Kathleen Turner, travels back in time to her high school senior year, 1960. She has an amusing interchange with her high school math teacher.

"I happend to know that in the future, I will not have the slightest use for algebra, and I speak from experience."

Think back to your high school algebra class.

1. Do you remember any important formulas from that class?

2. Did you hate, hate, hate high school algebra?

3. Did you love high school algebra?

Big question: Will you use high school algebra in your future?

## Second poll question

![Figure 3. Images of various computers](http://www.pmean.com/new-images/21/dark-side-02.png)

::: notes

How many of these computational devices have you used?

1. Laptop computer
2. Desktop computer
3. Tablet computer
4. Smart phone
5. Gaming console
6. Smart watch

Big question: What impact does the current generation's immersion of computing have on society?

## Are Statisticians Gods?

I'm helping someone who wants an alternative statistical analysis to the one used by the principal investigator. I'm happy to help and will offer advice about why my approach may be better, but I was warned that the PI considers the analysis chosen to be ordained by the **"Statistical Gods"** at her place of work.

::: notes

True story. I was asked to review a report from a federal agency, but was warned that negative comments, even if accurate, might not be well received because the agency's work was ordained by their Statistic Gods. At first, I thought this was amusing. If I could get the title of "Statistical God", I could double my hourly consulting rate. But deep down this story really bothered me. It implies that Statistical skills are supernatural, and only available to a select few special people. I learned Statistics through hard work, and you can learn Statistics through hard work also. Some people will learn it faster than others because they have good aptitudes in mathematics and programming. But there is nothing other than time to stop you.
