-   "Prank or not, Tartaro was playing with fire by going with NULL in the first place. 'He had it coming,' says Christopher Null, a journalist who has written previously for WIRED about the challenges his last name presents. 'All you ever get is errors and crashes and headaches.' If anything, Null says, the problem has gotten worse over the years. 'The "minimum viable product" concept has pushed a lot of bad code through that doesnâ€™t go through with the proper level of testing,' Null says, adding that anyone affected is inevitably an edge case, a relatively small problem not worth devoting a lot of resources to fix."
