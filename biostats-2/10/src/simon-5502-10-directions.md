## General directions

Read the article

-   Gina Kolata. How Bright Promise in Cancer Testing Fell Apart. The New York Times. 2011-07-07. Available in [html format][ref-kolata-2011].

[ref-kolata-2011]: https://www.nytimes.com/2011/07/08/health/research/08genes.html

and prepare report about it.

**Please work independently on this assignment.** You can have someone else review your report for grammar, spelling, organization, etc. before you submit it.

## Specific details

Your report should summarize what happened. Make sure that you address each of the following questions (not necessarily in this order).

-   Who was the villain?
-   Who was the victim?
-   How was the victim harmed?
-   What could have prevented this?
-   Did anything surprise you?
-   Is there a single quote from the article that summarizes it well?

Note that there may be more than one villain or more than one victim. Think broadly when you address these questions.

## Report specifications

The length is not too important. Two pages seems like a reasonable target, but shorter is fine as long as you address all of the questions. There is no upper limit on length, but do not ramble.

Write in a narrative format. A list (like "Who is the villain: Dr. Potti") is not acceptable. Use a 12 point font, at least a one inch margin on all sides, double spacing, indented paragraphs, and a title with your name at the top.

Convert your report into pdf format and submit it on the Canvas site. Include your last name, the number of the class (5510) and the module number in the name of the file that you submit.
