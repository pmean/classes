## What is mediation?

![](images/mediator-01.png)

-   "A situation when the relationship between a predictor variable and an outcome variable can be explained by their relationship to a third variable (the mediator)"
    -   Andy Field, Section 11.4
    
::: notes
The image and quote from your Andy Field textbook is about as good as anything. A mediator is a third variable which partially or totally explains the relationship between two variables. You'll see more of this next week's module, but I wanted to introduce it here, because it is a very important concept.

## Why do you need to understand mediation?

-   Mostly irrelevant for prediction
-   Very important for understanding mechanisms
    -   Is there a direct relationship?

There's a relationship between age and percentage body fat. It is a bit easier to follow if you convert age in years to age in decades. The relationship between decades of age and body fat is that you add about 1.8% to your body fat every decade on average.

The question is, how does this happen? Does some of the muscle turn directly into fat, or do you add fat through an expanding girth?

When you look at a model with both decade of age and abdomen circumference, the effect of age is cut markedly. Instead of adding 1.8% body fat on average, you add about 0.7% body fat on average. The rest of the body fat comes from the "love handles" that you develop as you age.

So gaining some fat is inevitable, even if you can still fit into those size 32 jeans that you wore as a young man. But much of the gain in percentage body fat comes from moving from size 32 over time to size 42.
