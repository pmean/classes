## Interaction between hours and effort

```{r}
i <- str_which(exercise_dictionary, "effort:")[1]
j <- which(nchar(exercise_dictionary[i:9999])==0)[1]
# cat(paste0(exercise_dictionary[i:(j-1)], "  \n"))
```


```{}
  effort: 
    label: weekly effort scores
    note: self report
    scale: 0 through 50
    direction:
      0 denoting minimal physical effort and
      50 denoting maximum effort.
```

-   hours = 2, effort = 30, predict 10.005
-   hours = 4, effort = 30, predict 10.005 + 2.291*2
-   hours = 2, effort = 40, predict 10.005 + 0.707*10
-   hours = 4, effort = 40, predict 10.005 + 2.291\*2 + 0.707\*10 + 0.393\*2\*20
