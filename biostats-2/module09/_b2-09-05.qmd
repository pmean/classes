## Did the pile of apples amount to more than just a hill of beans?

-   A significant meta-analysis is not enough
-   Effect sizes difficult to interpret

::: notes
Itâ€™s not enough to know that the overall effect of a therapy is positive. You have to balance the magnitude of the effect versus the added cost and/or the side effects of the new therapy. Unfortunately, most meta-analyses use an effect size (the improvement due to the therapy divided by the standard deviation). The effect size is unitless, allowing the combination of results from studies where slightly different outcomes with slightly different measurement units might have been used.

## Vote counting

-   Categorize individual studies
    -   Are some/most positive?
-   Negative, but trending studies

::: notes
Avoid "vote counting" or the tallying of positive versus negative studies. Vote counts ignore the possibility that some studies are negative solely because of their sample size. Abramson (1990) notes, for example, a meta-analysis of parenteral nutrition in cancer patients undergoing chemotherapy. Although each of the seven randomized control trials in the meta-analysis failed to achieve statistical significance, the pooled results were highly significant.

## Unitless measures

-   Convert back to original units
-   Example smoking cessation efforts during pregnancy
    -   Statistically significant
    -   Only a 28 gram difference in birthweight

::: notes
When you are examining a continuous outcome measure, you should be sure that the results are presented in interpretable units. A measure of effect size does not help you much because it is unitless and impossible to interpret. Consider a store that is offering a sale and announces boldly

"All prices reduced by 0.8 standard deviations!"

One meta-analysis shows how important it is to express measurements in interpretable units. Lumley et al (2001) studied the effect of smoking cessation programs on the health of the fetus and infant. One of the outcome measures was birth weight, and the study showed that the typical program can improve birth weight by a statistically significant amount. The researchers then quantified the amount: 28g (95% confidence interval 9 to 49).

Keep in mind that this is measuring the effectiveness of the smoking cessation program, and not the effect of smoking cessation directly. Typically, you would have to send about 12 to 16 women to these programs in order to get one extra woman to quit smoking. So the effect seen here reflects, in part, how difficult it is to get people to change their behavior.

Still the small size of the effect is important. If you want to assess the costs and benefits of smoking cessation programs, it helps to know that the impact of the typical smoking cessation program on birth weight is quite small. This provides a useful yardstick for comparison to other prenatal interventions.
