## Review multiple comparisons issue

-   Type I error: rejecting the null hypothesis when the null hypothesis is true.
    -   Multiple simultaneous hypotheses increase the Type I error rate.

## Bonferroni inequality for two simultaneous hypotheses

Define

-   $E_1$ = Type I error for Hypothesis 1
-   $E_2$ = Type I error for Hypothesis 2
    -   $P[E_1\ \cup\ E_2]=P[E_1]+P[E_2]-P[E_1\ \cap\ E_2]$
    -   $P[E_1\ \cup\ E_2]\ \le\ P[E_1]+P[E_2]$
    -   $P[E_1\ \cup\ E_2]\ \le\ P[E_1]+P[E_2]$
    -   $P[E_1\ \cup\ E_2]\ \le\ 2 \alpha$

## Bonferroni adjustment

-   For m hypotheses
    -   $P[E_1\ \cup\ ...\ \cup E_m]\ \le\ m \alpha$
-   Test each hypothesis at $\alpha/m$
    -   Preserves overall Type I error rate
-   Example, 3 simultaneous hypotheses
    -   Reject H0 if p-value \< 0.0133

## Controversies over Bonferroni adjustment

-   Increases Type II errors
-   Impractical for large values of m
-   Works poorly for highly correlated tests
-   Ambiguity in definition of "simultaneous" hypotheses

## Alternatives to Bonferroni adjustment

-   False discovery rate
-   Designation of primary and secondary outcomes
-   Subjective assessment of simultaneous hypotheses

## Review two-sample t-test

-   $H_0:\ \mu_1=\mu_2$
-   $H_1:\ \mu_1 \ne \mu_2$
    -   Or a one tailed alternative
-   $T=\frac{\bar X_1-\bar X_2}{SE(\bar X_1-\bar X_2)}$
    -   Accept H0 if T is close to zero.

::: notes
You saw how to compare two means last week. Here is the general framework.
:::

## What to do with three or more groups?

-   $H_0:\ \mu_1=\mu_2=...=\mu_k$
-   $H_1:\ \mu_i \ne \mu_j$ for some i, j
    -   Note: one-tailed test is tricky.
-   Accept H0 if the F ratio (defined below) is close to 1.

## Important assumptions

-   Same as independent-samples t-test
    -   Normality
    -   Equal variances
    -   Independence

## How to check assumptions

-   Boxplots
-   Analysis of residuals, $e_{ij}$
    -   $e_{ij}$= Observed - Predicted
    -   $e_{ij}= Y_{ij}-\bar{Y}_i$

## Tukey post hoc tests

-   If you reject H0, which values are unequal
    -   With k groups, there are k(k-1)/2 comparisons
-   Studentized range (Tukey test)
    -   Requires equal sample sizes per group
    -   Uses harmonic mean approximation for unequal sample sizes.
        -   Do not use harmonic means if seriously different sample sizes.

## Alternatives to Tukey post hoc tests

-   Bonferroni adjustment
    -   Works for unequal sample sizes per group
    -   Works for unequal variances
-   Dunnett's test
    -   Treatment versus multiple controls
-   Scheffe's test
    -   Works for complex comparison
        -   Example $\mu_1\ vs.\ \frac{\mu_2+\mu_3+\mu_4}{3}$

## Artificial data

::: notes
To motivate some of the calculations in Analysis of Variance, I created an artificial data set with numbers that are easy to work with.
:::

```{r}
library(ggplot2)
library(readr)
g <- rep(1:3, c(3, 5, 3))
y <- c(
  23, 30, 25, 
  33, 36, 41, 37, 43,
  24, 29, 31
)
ybarbar <- rep(mean(y), 11)
ybar <- rep(tapply(y, g, mean), c(3, 5, 3))
xpos <- c(1:3, 6:10, 13:15)
d <- data.frame(g, y, ybarbar, ybar, xpos)
sst <- (y-ybarbar)^2
ssw  <- (y-ybar)^2
ssb <- (ybar-ybarbar)^2
d[ , 1:2]
write_csv(d[ , 1:2], file="../data/data-08-artificial-anova.csv")
```

## Scatterplot

```{r}
ggplot(d, aes(xpos, y, col=factor(g))) +
  expand_limits(y=c(15,50), breaks=5**(3:10)) +
  scale_x_continuous(
      breaks=c(2, 8, 14), 
      minor=NULL,
      labels=1:3) +
  xlab(" ") +
  ylab(" ") +
  theme(legend.position="none") -> g1
  g1 + geom_text(label=y) -> g2
g2
```

::: notes
Here is a plot of the data.
:::

## Total SS = `r sum(sst)`

```{r}
g2 +
  geom_segment(xend=xpos, yend=ybarbar) +
  geom_text(y=ybarbar, label=ybarbar) +
  geom_text(y=15, label=sst)
```

::: notes
Total sums of squares is the squared deviation between each individual value and the overall mean.
:::

## Within SS = `r sum(ssw)`

```{r}
g2 +
  geom_segment(xend=xpos, yend=ybar) +
  geom_text(y=ybar, label=ybar) +
  geom_text(y=15, label=ssw)
```

::: notes
Within sums of squares is the squared deviation between each individual value and the group means.
:::

## Between SS = `r sum(ssb)`

```{r}
g1 +
  geom_text(y=ybar, label=ybar) +
  geom_segment(x=xpos, y=ybar, xend=xpos, yend=ybarbar) +
  geom_text(y=ybarbar, label=ybarbar) +
  geom_text(y=15, label=ssb)
```

::: notes
Between SS is the squared deviation between the group means and the overall mean.
:::

## Degrees of freedom

-   For Total SS, df = 10
-   For Within SS, df = 8
-   For Between SS, df = 2
-   In general,
    -   N = number of observations
    -   k = number of groups
        -   Total df = N-1
        -   Within df = N-k
        -   Between df = k-1

::: notes
The concept of degrees of freedom is tricky. It is the number of "independent" observations, or the number of observations minus the number of estimated parameters.

For Total SS, you have 11 observations, but one estimated parameter, the overall mean of 32. The degrees of freedom is 11-1 = 10.

For Within SS, you also have 11 observations, but there are 3 estimated parameters, the three group means. The degrees of freedom is 11-3 = 8

For Between SS, you only have three observations, the three group means. There is one estimated parameter, the overall mean. The degrees of freedom is 3-1 = 2.

In general, if you let N represent the total number of observations across all groups and let k represent the number of groups, then the degrees of freedom are N-1, N-k, and k-1.

## What belongs in an interpretation

"Sixty-six women with osteoporosis were alternately assigned to one of three treatment groups: Group 1 (n=22), group 2 (n=22), and controls (n=22). After 6 weeks, the change in bone mineral density from baseline was measured. Analysis with one-way ANOVA indicated a statistically significant difference between the groups (F_2,63=61.07, P \< 0.001). Further analysis with Tukey's pair-wise comparison procedure to control for multiple testing revealed that the mean change (+/- SD) of group 2 (1.6 g/cm\^2 +/-0.2) was significantly greater than that of group 1 (1.1 g/cm\^2 +/- 0.2) and that of the controls (1.0 g/cm\^2 +/- 0.2) with an overall alpha level of 0.05."

## Explain how subjects were assigned

"Sixty-six women with osteoporosis were **alternately assigned** to one of three treatment groups: Group 1 (n=22), group 2 (n=22), and controls (n=22).

## Yeast activation experiment

"To shorten the time it takes him tomake his favorite pizza, a student designed an experiment to test the effect of sugar and milk on the activation times for baking yeast. Specifically, he tested four different recipes and measured how many seconds it took for the same amount of dough to rise to the top of a bowl. He randomized the order of the recipes and replicated each treatment 4 times."

-   The average activation times were compared using oneway ANOVA with a Tukey post hoc follow-up test.

## Yeast analysis, interpretation, 2 of 3

-   There were statistically significant differences (p \< 0.001) in the activation times of the four recipes. Recipes D and B had similar average activation times which were significantly faster than Recipe A, which itself was significantly faster than recipe C.

## Yeast analysis, interpretation, 3 of 3

-   Recipes D and B were similar and had the fastest activation times. These differences were more than four minutes faster than the next best recipe which represents a practical as well as statistically significant result.
