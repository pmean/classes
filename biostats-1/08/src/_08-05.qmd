## Confidence interval for difference in means

-    $\bar{X}_1-\bar{X}_2 /pm t(1-\alpha/2, n_1+n_2-2) se$
     -   Range of plausible values for $\mu_1-\mu_2$

:::notes
The formula for a confidence interval for the difference between two means is shown here. The calculations are tedious, but not difficult.

## Interpretation

-   Statement about population mean difference ($\mu_1-\mu_2$)
-   Range of plausible values 
-   Not a probability statement
    -   95% confidence does not mean 95% probability
-   If you collected 100 independent samples,
    -   Roughly 95 would contain $\mu_1-\mu_2$
