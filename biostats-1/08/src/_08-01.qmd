## Population model

-   Population 1
    -   $X_{11},X_{12},...,X_{1N_1}$
    -   $X_{1i}$ are independent $N(\mu_1,\sigma_1)$
-   Population 2
    -   $X_{21},X_{22},...,X_{2N_2}$
    -   $X_{2i}$ are independent $N(\mu_2,\sigma_2)$


:::notes
The two sample t-test is based on a population model where there are $N_1$ observations in the first population and $N_2$ observations in the second population. In general, the size of the two populations, $N_1$ and $N_2$ are assumed to be very large.

## Sample values

-   Sample 1
    -   $X_{11},X_{12},...,X_{1n_1}$
    -   Calculate $\bar{X}_1$ and $S_1$
-   Sample 2
    -   $X_{21},X_{22},...,X_{2n_2}$
    -   Calculate $\bar{X}_2$ and $S_2$
    
:::notes
Because the populations are so large, you need to take a sample (hopefully a representative sample) from each population. With the sample, you can calculate sample statistics.

## Hypothesis and test statistic

-   $H_0:\ \mu_1 - \mu_2 = 0$
-   $H_1:\ \mu_1 - \mu_2 \ne 0$
    -   Accept $H_0$ if $\bar{X}_1-\bar{X}_2$ is close to zero
    
:::notes
The null hypothesis for the two-sample t-test is that the population means, $\mu_1$ and $\mu_2$ are equal, which is the same as saying that the difference between the two population means is equal to zero.

The population means are unknown, but you can use the sample means,

## How close is close?

-   $T = \frac{\bar{X}_1-\bar{X}_2}{se}$
-   se = standard error
    -  $se = S_p \sqrt{\frac{1}{n_1}+\frac{1}{n_2}}$
-  $S_p$ = Pooled standard deviation
       -   $S_p = \sqrt{\frac{n_1\ S_1^2\ +\ n_2\ S_2^2}{n_1\ +\ n_2}}$
-   Not valid with heterogeneity
    -   That is, $\sigma_1 \ne \sigma_2$

:::notes
You measure how close $\bar{X}_1 - \bar{X}_2$ is to zero by using the standard error. The standard error is a measure of how much sampling error you have when using $\bar{X}_1 - \bar{X}_2$ to estimate $\mu_1-\mu_2$.

This standard error relies on equal variation in both groups. You'll hear more discussion of this issue later in the presentation.
