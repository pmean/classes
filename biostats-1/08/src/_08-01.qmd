## Population model

-   Population 1
    -   $X_{11},X_{12},...,X_{1N_1}$
    -   $X_{1i}$ are independent $N(\mu_1,\sigma_1)$
-   Population 2
    -   $X_{21},X_{22},...,X_{2N_2}$
    -   $X_{2i}$ are independent $N(\mu_2,\sigma_2)$


:::notes
The two sample t-test is based on a population model where there are $N_1$ observations in the first population and $N_2$ observations in the second population. In general, the size of the two populations, $N_1$ and $N_2$ are assumed to be very large.

## Sample values

-   Sample 1
    -   $X_{11},X_{12},...,X_{1n_1}$
    -   Calculate $\bar{X}_1$ and $S_1$
-   Sample 2
    -   $X_{21},X_{22},...,X_{2n_2}$
    -   Calculate $\bar{X}_2$ and $S_2$
    
:::notes
Because the populations are so large, you need to take a sample (hopefully a representative sample) from each population. With the sample, you can calculate sample statistics.
