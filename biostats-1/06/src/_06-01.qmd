## The population model

-   $Y_i=\beta_0+\beta_1 X_i + \epsilon_i,\ i=1,...,N$
    -   $\epsilon_i$ is an unknown random variable
        -    Mean 0, standard deviation, $\sigma$
        -    Often assumed to be normal
    -   $\beta_0$ and $\beta_1$ are unknown parameters
    -   $b_0$ and $b_1$ are estimates from the sample
