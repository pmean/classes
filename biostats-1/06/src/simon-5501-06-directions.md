## Data

-   Download [albuquerque-housing-prices.csv][dat]
    -   Store it in your data folder

[dat]: https://github.com/pmean/datasets/blob/master/albuquerque-housing.csv
    
## Question 1

Calculate descriptive statistics (mean, standard deviation, minimum, and maximum for sqft. Interpret these numbers

## Question 2

Draw a plot with price on the y-axis and sqft on the x-axis. Include a linear regression line, but do not extend it beyond the range of the data. Interpret this plot.

## Question 3

Calculate a linear regression model using sqft to predict price. Interpret the slope and intercept.

## Question 4

Draw a normal probability plot and a histogram for the residuals (.resid). Interpret these plots.

## Question 5

Draw a scatterplot of sqft on the x-axis and the residuals on the y-axis. Is there evidence of non-linearity or heterogeneity?

## Question 6

Based on the diagnostic plots shown here, would you consider using a log transformation on price? There is no right or wrong answer, but I am interested in your opinion.
