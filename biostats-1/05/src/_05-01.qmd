## Bad joke, 1 of 4

![](../images/airplane-01.png)

::: notes
I borrowed this image from a movie poster. Does anyone know what movie this is?

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Airplane!

So I am using this as a setting for a bad Statistics joke.

Two statisticians are on an airplane, flying from Miami to Seattle. Fiften minutes into the flight, they hear a loud ...

... BANG! The pilot comes on the PA system and says "Excuse me, Ladies and Gentlemen. We've just had an engine explode. We'll be just fine with three engines, but instead of a three hour flight, this will now be a four hour flight."

The statisticians go back to talking, and fifteen minutes later, they hear another loud ...

... BANG! The pilot comes back on and says, "I'm sorry to report that we've had another engine explode. We can still make it to Seattle, but it will now be a six hour flight. I apologize for the additional delay."

The statisticians shrug and start talking again when fifteen minutes later, you guessed it, they hear a third loud  ...

... BANG! The pilot comes on again and says "I'm sorry to report that a third engine has exploded. Each engine on this jet is very powerful and we can still make it to Seattle, but it is now going to be a nine hour flight."

At this point, one statistician says to the other, "Boy, I hope this last engine doesn't fail ..."

"... or we'll be up here forever!"

This is an example of a dangerous extrapolation. The experience with three, two, and then only one engines may be consistent, but don't expect that trend to continue with zero engines.

## Quote from "Peggy Sue Got Married"

I want to get a quick feel for your background and interests. Here's a quote from a romantic comedy starring Kathleen Turner from 1986. A forty year old woman, played by Kathleen Turner, travels back in time to her high school senior year, 1960. She has an amusing interchange with her high school math teacher.

"I happend to know that in the future, I will not have the slightest use for algebra, and I speak from experience."

Think back to your high school algebra class.

1. Do you remember any important formulas from that class?

2. Did you hate, hate, hate high school algebra?

3. Did you love high school algebra?

Big question: Will you use high school algebra in your future?

## Algebra formula for a straight line

-   $Y=mx+b$
-   $m = \Delta y / \Delta x$
-   m = slope
-   b = y-intercept

::: notes
One formula in algebra that most people can recall is the formula for a straight line. Actually, there are several different formulas, but the one that most people cite is

Y = m X + b

where m represents the slope, and b represents the y-intercept (we'll call it just the intercept here). They can also sometimes remember the formula for the slope:

$m = \increment y / \increment x$

In English, we would say that this is the change in y divided by the change in x.
:::

## Linear regression interpretation of a straight line

-   The slope represents the estimated average change in Y when X increases by one unit.

-   The intercept represents the estimated average value of Y when X equals zero.

::: notes
In linear regression, we use a straight linear to estimate a trend in data. We can't always draw a straight line that passes through every data point, but we can find a line that "comes close" to most of the data. This line is an estimate, and we interpret the slope and the intercept of this line as follows:

Be cautious with your interpretation of the intercept. Sometimes the value X=0 is impossible, implausible, or represents a dangerous extrapolation outside the range of the data.

## Simple regression example with interpretation, 1

```{r setup-1}
#| message: false
#| warning: false
library(tidyverse)
load("../data/module05.RData")
```

```{r plot-bf-1}
bf |>
  ggplot(aes(mom_age, age_stop)) +
    geom_point() -> plot1
plot1
```

:::notes
Here is an illustration of a linear regression model. This data is from a study of breast feeding in pre-term infants. Successful breast feeding is more difficult for a pre-term infant because the mother goes home from the birth hospital before the infant. The independent variable, X, is the mother's age. The dependent variable is the age at which the infant stopped breast feeding. The goal is to reach at least six months of breast feeding.

Notice a weak trend here. Older mother's seem to do a bit better than younger mothers, but there are some 20 year old moms who breast feed for quite a long time and some 40 year old moms who stop breast feeding early. Still, there is a tendency for older moms to breast feed longer than younger moms.

## Simple regression example with interpretation, 2

```{r plot-bf-2}
plot1 +
  geom_smooth(
    method="lm",
    se=FALSE) -> plot2
plot2
```

:::notes
If you ask R to add a regression line, it stops at the range of the data. No dangerous extrapolations here!
:::

## Simple regression example with interpretation, 3

```{r plot-bf-3}
plot2 +
  expand_limits(x=0) +
  geom_segment(
    x=0, 
    y=b[1],
    xend=16,
    yend=b[1]+16*b[2],
    linetype="dotted")
```

::: notes
Here is a modification of the graph that expands the limits of the X axis to include X=0. This graph also extends the line beyond the range of the data all the way down to X=0. I used a dotted line and a different color to emphasize that this is an extrapolation beyond the range of the data.

The graph shown below represents the relationship between mother's age and the duration of breast feeding in a research study on breast feeding in pre-term infants.

The regression coefficients are shown below. The intercept, 6, is represented the estimated average duration of breast feeding for a mother that is zero years old. This is an impossible value, so the interpretation is not useful. What is useful, is the interpretation of the slope, approximately 0.4. The estimated average duration of breast feeding increases by 0.4 weeks for every extra year in the mother's age.
:::

## Predicted values, 1

-   How long would you expect a 20 year old mom to breast feed?

```{r predict-20}
bf |>
  filter(mom_age==20) |>
  select(mom_age, age_stop)
```

:::notes
Easy way out is to find a 20 year old mother in the data. That is actually not such a good idea. But there are five of them, four if you are only counting non-missing values. 

In a different dataset maybe you have data on 19 and 21 year olds but no 20 year olds.

If you predict using a linear regression model, you are incorporating information from all mothers into your prediction, not just 20 year old mothers. Unless there are some major problems with the regression model, this is a much better choice.
:::

## Predicted values, 2

-   $\hat{Y}_i = b_0+b_1 X_i$
-   $\hat{Y}_{new} = b_0+b_1 X_{new}$
    -   Do not predict outside the range of X values

:::notes
To make a prediction at an existing value in the dataset, use the first formula. If you want to make a prediction at a value that is not in your dataset, use the same formula, but notice that the subscript is "new" to emphasize that this is a new value not seen before in the data. Be careful here. It is okay to make predictions inside the range of the X values. In the breast feeding example that I have been talking about, it is okay to make predictions for a mother between the ages of 16 and 44, but making predictions for a 14 year old mother or a 50 year old mother is risky. You could be making a dangerous extrapolation.

## Predicted values, 3

```{r predict}
augment(m1, 
  newdata =
    data.frame(
      mom_age=20))

Here is the predicted value from R.
