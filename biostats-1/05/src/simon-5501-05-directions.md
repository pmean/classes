## Question 1

Calculate descriptive statistics for gestational age (mean, standard deviation, minimum, and maximum) and count the number of missing values. Interpet these results.

## Question 2

Calculate descriptive statistics for age at discharge from the birth hospital and count the number of missing values. Interpet these results.

## Question 3

Pre-term infants spend a longer amount of time in the hospital than full-term infants. In fact, the earlier the baby appears, the longer the amount of time that the infant remains in the birth hospital. Draw a scatterplot to examine whether this pattern holds in this dataset. Consider age at discharge to be the outcome variable when deciding how to draw this scatterplot.

Be sure to use descriptive labels for the two axes, including units of measurement.

## Question 4

## Your submission

-   Save the output in html format
-   Convert it to pdf format.
-   Make sure that the pdf file includes
    -   Your last name
    -   The number of this course
    -   The number of this module
-   Upload the file

## If it doesn't work

If your program has any errors or fails
to produce the output that you desire 
and you can't resolve the problem, 
upload the program file along with the
pdf file to help us figure out what 
went wrong. You will get a chance to 
resubmit the assignment if needed.
