There is a [data dictionary][dd] that provides more details about the data. The program was written by Steve Simon on 2024-09-02 and is placed in the public domain.

[dd]: https://github.com/pmean/datasets/blob/master/fev.yaml

## Libraries

The tidyverse library is the only one you need for  this program.

```{r setup}
#| message: false
#| warning: false
library(tidyverse)
```

## List variable names

Since the variable names are not listed in the data file itself, you need to list them here.

```{r names}
fev_names <- c(
    "age",
    "fev",
    "ht",
    "sex",
    "smoke")
```

## Reading the data

Here is the code to read the data and show a glimpse. 

```{r read}
fev <- read_csv(
  file="../data/fev.csv",
  col_names=fev_names,
  col_types="nnncc")
glimpse(fev)
```
