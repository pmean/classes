## Diagnosing distributional issues (1/2)

-   For all data
    -   $\bar{X} \gg X_{0.5}$
    -   $\bar{X}$ and/or $X_{0.5}$ not midway between $Q_1$ and $Q_3$
    -   $\bar{X}$ and/or $X_{0.5}$ not midway between min and max

The best way to decide whether your data follows a bell shaped curve is by looking at a histogram. But this is not always an option. When you are reading a journal article, you probably only get descriptive statistics and not a histogram.

There are certain patterns, however, that you might see in the descriptive statistics that SOMETIMES help you assess when the data does not follow a bell shaped curve.

These don't diagnose every possible deviation from the bell shaped curve, so some types of deviations might be undiagnosed. But if you see any of these patterns, they are definitely indicative of non-normality.

If the mean is a lot larger than the median, it is almost always because of some extreme values, but only on the high end.

If the data is lop-sided, either because the mean/median are not midway between the upper and lower quartiles or because they are not midway between the smallest value and the largest value, this indicates a lack of symmetry and is inconsistent with the bell shaped curve.

## Diagnosing distributional issues (2/2)

-   For non-negative data
    -   $S > 0.5 \times \bar{X}$
-   For data with an lower and/or upper bound
    -   $Q_1$ = lower bound
    -   $Q_3$ = upper bound
-   Don't overdiagnose, especially with small sample sizes!

*Speaker notes*

For non-negative data, data with a lower bound of zero, a large standard deviation, one that is half the size of the mean or greater, you would have the mean minus two standard deviations go negative. That's a pretty good sign that trying to apply the mean plus or minus two standard deviations is not going to make much sense.

If there is another lower bound, or perhaps an upper bound to the data, see if one of the quartiles hits these bounds. If the 75th percentile equals the upper bound, that means that a quarter of your data is piled up at the upper bound. There's no way this could be consistent with a bell shaped curve.

Be careful not to overdiagnose. Don't try to look for subtle patterns. A mean that is just slightly larger than the median or not quite halfway between the lower and upper quartiles is not a cause for concern.

*Speaker notes*

Here is part of a table for this article that gives a fair amount of detail about the ages of the veterans in this research study.

The data here looks fairl well behaved. The mean and the median are close to one another. Ages are non-negative, so you could look at the standard deviation. A really large standard deviation could be trouble, but here is is around 13, nowhere close to half of the mean. The mean and median both find themselves about midway between the two quartiles and between the minimum and maximum values.

*Speaker notes*

CCI is short for the Charlson Comorbidity Index. It is a weighted sum of nineteen medical conditions.The larger the value of CCI, the sicker the patient.

The CCI has a lower bound of zero, so you can see a problem right away. The standard deviations are about the same size or a bit bigger than the mean. The mean and medians are about midway between the two quartiles, but when you look at the minimum and maximum, there is quite a different story.

This is indeed not normally distributed.

PHQ-2 is a quality of life measure. It ranges from 0 to 6. The very large standard deviations, both quite a bit bigger than the means, indicates strong evidence of non-normality.

Symptom persistence weeks after laboratory-confirmed severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) clearance is a relatively common long-term complication of Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19). Little is known about this phenomenon in older adults. The present study aimed at determining the prevalence of persistent symptoms among older COVID-19 survivors and identifying symptom patterns.

The mean age was 73.1 ± 6.2 years (median 72, interquartile range 27), and 63 (38.4%) were women. The average time elapsed from hospital discharge was 76.8 ± 20.3 days (range 25-109 days).

::: notes
*Speaker notes*

There are fewer statistics presented here. Age and time since discharge are both non-negative, so you can compare the standard deviation to the mean. No problems here. It might be worth calculating the mean plus or minus two standard deviations. Rounding a bit you get 61 to 85 for age and 37 to 117 for time

Background. Insomnia is one of the major health problems related with a decrease in quality of life (QOL) and also in poor functioning in night-shift nurses, that also may negatively affect patients' care. The aim of this study is to evaluate the prevalence of insomnia in night shift nurses.

Break into small groups. The first group take the first four measures and the second group take the last four measures. Is there evidence that the data is non-normally distributed?

Also, calculate the mean plus of minus two standard deviations for any observations that report the mean and standard deviation.
