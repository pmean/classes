## Calculation of the mean and median

-   Mean
    -   Add up all the values, divide by the sample size
-   Median
    -   Sort the data
        -   Select the middle value if n is odd
        -   go halfway between the two middle values if n is even

You already know how to compute the average. Add up all the values and divide by the sample size.

The median is also simple. Sort the data and choose the "middle" value. If n is odd, there is one value that is right in the middle. With five data values, the median is the third value of the sorted list. The first and second values are smaller and the fourth and fifth values are larger.

With an even number, there are two middle values. Go halfway between them. If you have eight data values, the midpoint between the fourth and fifth values splits the data in half. The first through fourth values in the sorted list are smaller and the fifth through eighth values are larger.

## Formal mathematical definitions

-   Mean
    -   $\bar{X}=\frac{1}{n}\Sigma X_i$
-   Median
    -   Sorted values $X_{[1]},X_{[2]},...,X_{[n]}$
        -   $X_{[(n+1)/2]}$ if n is odd,
        -   $(X_{[n/2]}+X_{[n/2+1]})/2$ if n is even

Here are the mathematical formulas for the mean and median. I know some people hate formulas, but I love them. With a few symbols and Greek letters, you can express really deep and beautiful ideas. Well these formulas aren't all that deep.

Here is some data that I got off the web.

https://dasl.datadescription.com/datafile/legionnaires-disease/

This represents bacteria counts before and after a new air conditioning unit was installed in a small hotel.

I want to illustrate the calculation of the mean and median.
:::

## Before remediation mean

```{r}
adds_0 <- paste0(bacteria_0, collapse=" + ") 
sum_0 <- sum(bacteria_0)
mean_0 <- mean(bacteria_0)
```

```         
`r adds_0` = `r sum_0`

`r sum_0` / 8 = `r mean_0`

Round to `r round(mean_0, 1)`
```

::: notes
*Speaker notes*

Here's the data for bacterial counts before remediation. If you add the eight values up, you get `r sum_0`. Divide this by eight to get `r mean_0`. Always round liberally when you are talking about the mean.
:::

## After remediation mean

```{r}
adds_1 <- paste0(bacteria_1, collapse=" + ") 
sum_1 <- sum(bacteria_1)
mean_1 <- mean(bacteria_1)
```

```         
`r adds_1` = `r sum_1`

`r sum_1` / 8 = `r mean_1`

Round to `r round(mean_1, 1)`
```

::: notes
*Speaker notes*

Here are the same calculations for the bacterial counts after remediation.
:::

## Before remediation median (1/4)

```{r}
space <- function(x) {
  x1 <- rep("", 15)
  x1[2*(1:8)-1] <- x
  return(x1)
}

sq <- function(x) {
  paste0(x, collapse="\n")
}

step1 <- function(x) {
  y <- sprintf("%4.1f", x)
  room %>%
    paste(y, sep="  ") %>%
    space
}
```

```         
`r sq(step1(bacteria_0))`
```

::: notes
*Speaker notes*

Now for the median.

Here is the data for bacteria counts before remediation. Notice that the data is arranged by room number.
:::

## Before remediation median (2/4)

```{r}
step2 <- function(x) {
  o <- order(x)
  y <- sprintf("%4.1f", x[o])
  room[o] %>%
    paste(y, sep="  ") %>%
    space
}
```

```         
`r sq(step2(bacteria_0))`
```

::: notes
*Speaker notes*

The first thing you do is sort the data from the lowest bacteria count to the highest bacteria count.

The data was arranged by room number, but now it is arranged by bacterial count. The smallest bacteria count is listed at the top and the largest is listed at the bottom.
:::

## Before remediation median (3/4)

```{r}
step3 <- function(x, div=4:5) {
  o <- order(x)
  y <- rep("", 8)
  y[div] <- x[o][div]
  step2(x) %>%
    paste(space(y), sep="  ")
}
```

```         
`r sq(step3(bacteria_0))`
```

::: notes
*Speaker notes*

Then pick out the middle value. If you have an even number of data points, there will be two middle values.

In this data set, the two middle values are the fourth and fifth largest values out of eight.
:::

## Before remediation median (4/4)

```{r}
step4 <- function(x, div=4:5) {
  o <- order(x)
  x1 <- x[o]
  x4 <- step3(x, div)
  blanks <- paste0(rep(" ", 18), collapse="")
  x4[2*div[1]] <- glue(
    "{blanks}",
    "({x1[div[1]]} + {x1[div[2]]}) / 2",
    " = {(x1[div[1]]+x1[div[2]])/2}")
  return(x4)
}
```

```         
`r sq(step4(bacteria_0)) `
```

::: notes
*Speaker notes*

If there are two middle values, just average them.
:::

## After remediation median (1/4)

```         
`r sq(step1(bacteria_1))`
```

::: notes
*Speaker notes*

Here is the data for bacteria counts after remediation.
:::

## After remediation median (2/4)

```         
`r sq(step2(bacteria_1))`
```

::: notes
*Speaker notes*

Just like before, you sort the data.
:::

## After remediation median (3/4)

```         
`r sq(step3(bacteria_1))`
```

::: notes
*Speaker notes*

Then pick out the middle value. Here again, there are two middle values.
:::

## After remediation median (4/4)

```         
`r sq(step4(bacteria_1)) `
```

::: notes
*Speaker notes*

Just average the two middle values.

## Criticisms of the mean and median

-   Are you combining apples and onions?
-   Are you ignoring minorities?

::: notes
*Speaker notes*

There's a wonderful cartoon by Dana Fradon that appeared in The New Yorker in 1976. She shows a road going into town and the sign by the side of the road reads "Hillsdale, Founded 1802, Altitude 600, Population 3,700. Total 6,122." You can't add these things together.

It's similar for means. There was a dataset showing housing prices for homes in Boston and none of the analyses seemed to make sense. The problem in Boston is that a small number of the houses had prices that were out of sync with their other homes. These were historical houses, such as Paul Revere's house.

When you are averaging numbers, maybe it's okay to have a few oranges in with the apples. A mix of apples and oranges is just fruit salad. You shouldn't have a problem with that.

When it becomes a problem is when the data are so diverse that it becomes a mix of apples and onions. There are lots of great recipes that mix apples and oranges, but none that mix apples and onions.

The other problem is that an average may be a reasonable number to represent the majority of patients in your sample, but it may masks some important trends that appear in a minority.

This is a big problem in a larger context than just the mean or median. There are some very fancy high tech prediction models that work very well for most people and the statistics like the mean and median back this up quite nicely. But the prediction models perform terribly for minority groups. Something that does well for the average person may not be so great for a large segment of society.

![Excerpt from Gould 1985 publication](../images/gould-1985.png)

::: notes
*Speaker notes*

Stephen Jay Gould was a famous Evolutionary Biologist. He was a prolific writer with 20 books and 300 essays. Much of his writing was for academic researchers, but just as much was for the general public.

One of his most famous essays was "The Median Isn't the Message". The title is a take-off of a quote by Marshall McLuhan, "The medium is the message" which itself has an interesting history that you should investigate on your own.

The Gould essay was written in 1985 for Discover Magazine. It has been reprinted many times, and you can easily find the full text with a simple Google search.

The image shown here is taken from phoenix5.org, an informational site for patients with prostate cancer.

Gould was diagnosed with a rare cancer, abdominal mesothelioma, with a very poor prognosis. Such a poor prognosis that Gould was actively discouraged by his physician from looking at any peer reviewed research about his cancer.

But Gould looked anyway. "Of course, trying to keep an intellectual away from literature works about as well as recommending chastity to Homo sapiens, the sexiest primate of all."

But he found that the doctor had good reason to discourage this trip to the medical library.

"The literature couldn't have been more brutally clear: Mesothelioma is incurable, with a median mortality of only eight months after discovery."

Gould was momentarily distressed, but then he thought carefully about the problem.

"When I learned about the eight-month median, my first intellectual reaction was: Fine, half the people will live longer; now what are my chances of being in that half? I read for a furious and nervous hour and concluded, with relief: damned good. I possessed every one of the characteristics conferring a probability of longer life: I was young; my disease had been recognized in a relatively early stage; I would receive the nation's best medical treatment; I had the world to live for; I knew how to read the data properly and not despair."

He goes on to find a bit more reason for optimism.

"Another technical point then added even more solace. I immediately recognized that the distribution of variation about the eight-month median would almost surely be what statisticians call"right skewed." (In a symmetrical distribution, the profile of variation to the left of the central tendency is a mirror image of variation to the right. Skewed distributions are asymmetrical, with variation stretching out more in one direction than the other---left skewed if extended to the left, right skewed if stretched out to the right.) The distribution of variation had to be right skewed, I reasoned. After all, the left of the distribution contains an irrevocable lower boundary of zero (since mesothelioma can only be identified at death or before). Thus, little space exists for the distribution's lower (or left) half---it must be scrunched up between zero and eight months. But the upper (or right) half can extend out for years and years, even if nobody ultimately survives. The distribution must be right skewed, and I needed to know how long the extended tail ran---for I had already concluded that my favorable profile made me a good candidate for the right half of the curve."

Gould did indeed find himself on the happy side of the eight month median, a good 20 years beyond the median.

The median isn't the message. It is a single number with half the people on the lower side and half on the higher side. Don't think for a minute that single number like a median can characterize everyone in a group.

## Choosing between the mean and median

-   Often, either is fine
-   When do you use the mean?
    -   When totals are important
    -   "In 2020, the average expenditure by the Italian National Health Service (Servizio Sanitario Nazionale, SSN) per patient affected by at least one chronic disease was approximately 696 euros."
-   When do you use the median
    -   When outliers/skewness might distort your conclusions

::: notes
*Speaker notes*

While there is some consensus on when to use the mean versus the median, the choice is not always obvious. Controversies often arise over this issue.

Here are some general guidelines.

Most of the time, either the mean or the median is fine.

One big advantage of the mean is that it allows extrapolation to totals. This is often important in the analysis of the economic effects of illness.

I found this data on the web site statista.com. The average cost per patient with at least one chronic disease was 696 euros. If you wanted to extrapolate this average and get a total cost for the whole country, multiply by the number of people in Italy times the proportion who have one or more chronic diseases.

The other issue is outliers. Extreme values tend to pull the mean towards that value.

We have this guy living in the United States named Elon Musk. My wife idolizes him. She bought a Tesla from his company and brags about it to all her friends. She's a big fan of his space exploration efforts and is fascinated by a possible manned flight to Mars.

Me, I think he is just a rich jerk. But suppose you are computing average net worth of a random sample of individuals and by your good luck (my wife's perspective) or bad luck (my perspective) Elon Musk gets to be part of your sample. The average net worth approaches a billion dollars because all the money that Musk has swamps the total. No one else in the sample has a net worth anywhere near a billion dollars, so the mean is not a fair reflection of the average person in the sample. The median net worth doesn't change if Musk's net worth is 400 billion dollars, before he bought Twitter or 200 billion after he bought Twitter.

Now the Elon Musk example is silly, but the issue of outliers having an effect on the mean is important in many applications.

![Chen et al 2019](../images/chen-2019.png)

Here is an article I found on PubMed, one of my favorite websites that compares median and mean improvements in life expectancy in cancer patients.
:::

## Chen 2019, PMID: 31806195 (continued)

Background: The prices of newly approved cancer drugs have risen over the past decades. **A key policy question is whether the clinical gains offered by these drugs in treating specific cancer indications justify the price increases.**

::: notes
*Speaker notes*

Here's part of the abstract.

The United States is like a lot of first world countries in that we spend more and more money each year on cancer treatments. Are we getting our money's worth?
:::

## Chen 2019, PMID: 31806195 (continued)

Results: We found that between 1995 and 2012, price increases outstripped median survival gains, a finding consistent with previous literature. **Nevertheless, price per mean life-year gained increased at a considerably slower rate, suggesting that new drugs have been more effective in achieving longer-term survival.** Between 2013 and 2017, price increases reflected equally large gains in median and mean survival, resulting in a flat profile for benefit-adjusted launch prices in recent years.

::: notes
*Speaker notes*

Later on in the abstract, the authors point out that from the persective of the median, things are bleak. The median survival gains are not in line with the increasing amount of money spent on new treatments. But the mean survival gains show a different story. A flat profile means that increases in price are accompanied by an increase in benefits in terms of gains in the mean. What this implies is that the extreme tail of the distribution includes a number of Elon Musk types. A small number of people are showing amazingly big gains in survival, justifying the increase in cost.
