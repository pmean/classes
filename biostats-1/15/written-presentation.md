## Report

Using the dataset that you discussed in your oral presentation, prepare a report documenting your hypothesis test. Your report should include

-   Descriptive statistics
-   At least one plot of the data
-   The formal hypothesis using Greek letters
-   The p-value and the confidence interval
-   Tables and plots that help evaluate the underlying assumptions


Include anything else you feel is helpful, but do not go overboard!.

You should not run an alternative test if you find some problems with the assumptions. Do state, however, whether you recommend an alternative based on your examination of the assumptions.

## Data dictionary

In a separate file, prepare a data dictionary using the general structure and order that you have seen in class. This should be a text file with a yaml extension. Let me know if I can make your dataset available for future students or if it is not to be shared for whatever reason. Your grade will not depend on whether you can share your data dictionary with future students.

Key elements in a data dictionary include

-   Copyright
-   Description
-   Whether variable names are included with the file
-   What the missing value code is (or "not needed")
-   Labels for any variable where the variable name itself is not sufficient
-   Units of measurement (or "unknown")

Include anything else you think is helpful, but again, please don't go overboard! I have to grade a large number of these and do not wish to wade through reports that are dozens of pages long.

## Grading rubric

-   Did you select the appropriate test statistic? This element addresses student learning objective 1 (select appropriate statistical procedures)
    -   Poor (0 points) There are two or more major errors or omissions in the selection of descriptive statistics, test statistics, or checks of the test assumptions.
    -   Fair (2 points) There is one major or two minor errors or omissions.
    -   Good (4 points) There are no major or minor errors or omissions.

-   Did your report include appropriate interpretations for every table and figure? There is some latitude for differences in opinion, but you will lose points if your interpretations that are clearly out of line with the results. This element also addresses student learning objective 1 (accurately interpret statistical results)
    -   Poor (0 points) Interpretations are bad (missing or clearly out of line) in four or more places
    -   Fair (2 points) Interpretations are bad in two or more places
    -   Good (4 points) Interpretations are reasonable throughout, allowing for appropriate differences in opinion
    
-   Did your R program run properly? This element also addresses student learning objective 1 (apply appropriate statistical procedures)
    -   Poor (0 points) Code has two or more major errors or omissions or code is poorly laid out in four or more places, making it difficult to understand the objectives.
    -   Fair (2 points) Code has one major or two minor errors or omissions or two places where the code is difficult to follow.
    -   Good (4 points) Code has no major or minor errors and is laid out carefully throughout, making it easy to understand the objectives.

-   Was your report well written (good grammar, proper spelling, clear explanations)? This element addresses student learning objective 5 (convey statistical findings)
    -   Poor (0 points) Four or more problems with grammar, spelling or clarity serious enough to hamper the ability to understand your report.
    -   Fair (2 points) Two or more serious problems
    -   Good (4 points) Only one or two problems, none of which serious hampered the readability of your report.

-   Was the data dictionary complete?
    -   Poor (0 points) Missing four or more key elements
    -   Fair (2 points) Missing two key elements
    -   Good (4 points) All important elements are included
