## Dataset

Identify a dataset that has not been used in this class or in the Introduction to R, Introduction to SAS, or Introduction to SQL class. This dataset should not be too complicated, but it must provide enough information to allow you to test a hypothesis using simple linear regression (one independent variable), a two-sample t-test, or a one factor analysis of variance. These hypotheses all presume that your outcome variable is continuous and not categorical. In the last couple of weeks of this class, you will learn how to test a hypothesis involving analyze a categorical outcome, so it is best to avoid this type of hypothesis for now.

## Presentation

Then prepare a five minute presentation with slides that discusses the details of your data and what hypothesis you wish to test with this data. Do not present any of your data analysis. That will be presented as a written report in a separate assignment. Be prepeared to answer questions after your talk is done.

## Grading rubric

-   Did you select an appropriate hypothesis? This element addresses student learning objective 2 (design a testable research question or hypothesis)
    -   Poor (0 points) The hypothesis was missing or completely inappropriate for the dataset.
    -   Fair (2 points) There was some ambiguity in the description of the hypothesis or minor errors in the notation
    -   Good (4 points) The hypothesis was clearly described, accurate, and appropriate for the dataset.

-   Did you use an effective speaking style (vocal variety, effective use of pauses)? This element also addresses student learning objective 5 (communicate scientific outcomes).
    -   Poor (0 points) Talk was largely monotone with no variation in pace and no pauses.
    -   Fair (2 points) Talk made limited use of vocal variety and pauses.
    -   Good (4 points) Talk made good use throughout of vocal variety and pauses.

-   Were your slides clear, easy to read, and well-organized? This element also addresses student learning objective 5 (communicate scientific outcomes).
    -   Poor (0 points) More than half of the slides were difficult to read because of small fonts and/or too much text or were presented in a random and haphazard order
    -   Fair (2 points) Two or more slides were difficult to read or the order was confusing at times
    -   Good (4 points) Only minor problems with readable. Careful and well thought out order of presentation.

-   Did you finish within the established time limit? This element also addresses student learning objective 5.
    -   More than 120 seconds over time (0 points)  
    -   61 seconds to 120 seconds over time (1 point)
    -   31 seconds to 60 seconds over time (2 points)
    -   Up to 30 seconds over time (3 points)
    -   On time (five minutes zero seconds or under) (4 points)

-   Did you effectively field questions about your hypothesis? This element also addresses student learning objective 5 (effectively field questions in an oral presentation format).
    -   Poor (0 points) Failed to provide an appropriate answer to one or more of the questions posed after the study ended.
    -   Fair (2 points) Answers were incomplete or provided only a limited perspective on the biological, biomedical, or population context of the data.
    -   Good (4 points) Answers showed good understanding of context of the data while answering all questions.
