## Dataset

Identify a dataset that has not been used in this class or in the Introduction to R, Introduction to SAS, or Introduction to SQL class. This dataset should not be too complicated, but it must provide enough information to allow you to test a hypothesis using simple linear regression (one independent variable), a two-sample t-test, or a one factor analysis of variance. These hypotheses all presume that your outcome variable is continuous and not categorical. In the last couple of weeks of this class, you will learn how to test a hypothesis involving analyze a categorical outcome, so it is best to avoid this type of hypothesis for now.

## Where can I find an interesting dataset

Many of you will have access to interesting data from your workplace. Don't use anything that is highly sensitive. If you find something, check with your supervisor to see if it is okay to use it for this project. If they say it is okay, ask if the data can be shared more broadly, such as for future students working on similar assignments. It's okay if you can't share your data more broadly.

If you do not have access to anything at work, there are numerous resources on the Internet that share datasets. While these resources can list hundreds, if not thousands, of datasets, many of them will not be appropriate for this project. They may be too simple to allow for an interesting research hypothesis. They may be too complicated. They may not have outcome data that is continuous. Keep looking and you should be able to find something that works.

    -   Vincent Arel-Brundock. R Datasets. "Rdatasets is a collection of 2337 datasets which were originally distributed alongside the statistical software environment R and some of its add-on packages. The goal is to make these data more broadly accessible for teaching and statistical software development." Available in a [github repository](https://vincentarelbundock.github.io/Rdatasets/index.html).
    -   Gordon K. Smyth. Australian Data and Story Library. "OzDASL is a library of data sets and associated stories. It is intended as a resource for teachers of statistics in Australia and New Zealand and elsewhere. Emphasis is given to data sets with an Australasian context, although interesting data sets from anywhere in the world are included. Data sets are grouped by the most obvious applicable methodology. However these are not exclusive. For example, data sets with several variables can often be used for simple linear regression as well as for multiple regression, and almost any variable provides an example of a single sample. Methods are listed from simple to advance, in much the same order as they would be introduced in a statistics course. Even within methods, data sets are listed in order of size and complexity, from simple to advanced." Available in [html format](https://gksmyth.github.io/ozdasl/index.html).
    -   Data Description. Welcome to DASL - The Data and Story Library. "Welcome to the Data and Story Library, an archive of hundreds of datafiles for use by students and teachers of statistics and data science. We host data on a wide variety of topics to provide real-world examples. We recognize that data are not just numbers; data require a context. DASL provides background information about the data and a source reference whenever that information is available. That’s the “Story” part of our name."

## Presentation

Then prepare a five minute presentation with slides that discusses the details of your data and what hypothesis you wish to test with this data. Do not present any of your data analysis. That will be presented as a written report in a separate assignment. Be prepeared to answer questions after your talk is done.

## Grading rubric

-   Did you select an appropriate hypothesis? This element addresses student learning objective 2 (design a testable research question or hypothesis)
    -   Poor (0 points) The hypothesis was missing or completely inappropriate for the dataset.
    -   Fair (2 points) There was some ambiguity in the description of the hypothesis or minor errors in the notation
    -   Good (4 points) The hypothesis was clearly described, accurate, and appropriate for the dataset.
-   Did you use an effective speaking style (vocal variety, effective use of pauses)? This element also addresses student learning objective 5 (communicate scientific outcomes).
    -   Poor (0 points) Talk was largely monotone with no variation in pace and no pauses.
    -   Fair (2 points) Talk made limited use of vocal variety and pauses.
    -   Good (4 points) Talk made good use throughout of vocal variety and pauses.
-   Were your slides clear, easy to read, and well-organized? This element also addresses student learning objective 5 (communicate scientific outcomes).
    -   Poor (0 points) More than half of the slides were difficult to read because of small fonts and/or too much text or were presented in a random and haphazard order
    -   Fair (2 points) Two or more slides were difficult to read or the order was confusing at times
    -   Good (4 points) Only minor problems with readable. Careful and well thought out order of presentation.
-   Did you finish within the established time limit? This element also addresses student learning objective 5.
    -   More than 120 seconds over time (0 points)
    -   61 seconds to 120 seconds over time (1 point)
    -   31 seconds to 60 seconds over time (2 points)
    -   Up to 30 seconds over time (3 points)
    -   On time (five minutes zero seconds or under) (4 points)
-   Did you effectively field questions about your hypothesis? This element also addresses student learning objective 5 (effectively field questions in an oral presentation format).
    -   Poor (0 points) Failed to provide an appropriate answer to one or more of the questions posed after the study ended.
    -   Fair (2 points) Answers were incomplete or provided only a limited perspective on the biological, biomedical, or population context of the data.
    -   Good (4 points) Answers showed good understanding of context of the data while answering all questions.
