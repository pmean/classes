## Download program

Download two program templates:

-   [simon-5501-04-fev.qmd][sim1]
-   [simon-5501-04-gardasil.qmd][sim2]

[sim1]: https://github.com/pmean/classes/blob/master/biostats-1/04/src/simon-5501-04-fev.qmd
[sim2]: https://github.com/pmean/classes/blob/master/biostats-1/04/src/simon-5501-04-gardasil.qmd

and store them in your src folder.

## Download data

Also download the data files:

-   [fev.csv][sim3]
-   [gardasil.csv][sim4]

[sim3]: https://github.com/pmean/data/blob/main/files/fev.csv
[sim4]: https://github.com/pmean/data/blob/main/files/gardasil.csv

and store them in your data folder. You may already have the first file from a previous homework assignment. You may wish to review the data dictionaries

-   [fev.yaml][sim5]
-   [gardasil.yaml][sim6]

[sim5]: https://github.com/pmean/data/blob/main/files/fev.yaml
[sim6]: https://github.com/pmean/data/blob/main/files/gardasil.yaml

## Question #1

Use the  simon-5501-04-fev.qmd file. Update the program to calculate descriptive statistics (mean, standard deviation, minimum, and maximum) for ht. Interpret these statistics.

## Question #2

Draw a scatterplot of ht versus fev. Place ht on the x-axis and fev on the y-axis. Interpret this plot.

## Question #3

Calculate the correlation between ht and fev. Interpret this correlation.

## Question #4

Calculate counts and percentages for sex. Please be sure to convert sex from the numeric codes into a factor. Interpret these statistics.

## Question #5

Draw a boxplot for sex and fev. Interpret this boxplot.

## Question #6

Calculate the difference in average fev values between males and females. Is this a large or a small difference? Calculate the effect size by dividing by the standard deviation of the females. Is this a small, medium, or large effect size?

## Question #7

Use the simon-5501-04-gardasil.qmd file. Summarize and interpret the percentage of patients receiving medical assistance. Be sure to convert the number codes for this variable into labels using the factor function.

## Question #8

Draw a bar chart showing the percentages for number of shots received by whether the patient received medical assistance. Interpret this chart.
