Here are the directions for the programming assignment in module04 of MEDB 5501.

## Download program

Download two program templates:

-   [simon-5501-04-fev.qmd][sim1]
-   [simon-5501-04-gardasil.qmd][sim2]

[sim1]: https://github.com/pmean/classes/blob/master/biostats-1/04/src/simon-5501-04-fev.qmd
[sim2]: https://github.com/pmean/classes/blob/master/biostats-1/04/src/simon-5501-04-gardasil.qmd

and store them in your src folder.

## Download data

Also download the data files:

-   [fev.csv][sim3]
-   [gardasil.csv][sim4]

[sim3]: https://github.com/pmean/data/blob/main/files/fev.csv
[sim4]: https://github.com/pmean/data/blob/main/files/gardasil.csv

and store them in your data folder. You may already have the first file from a previous homework assignment. You may wish to review the data dictionaries

-   [fev.yaml][sim5]
-   [gardasil.yaml][sim6]

[sim5]: https://github.com/pmean/data/blob/main/files/fev.yaml
[sim6]: https://github.com/pmean/data/blob/main/files/gardasil.yaml

## Question #1

Use the  simon-5501-04-fev.qmd file. Update the program to calculate descriptive statistics (mean, standard deviation, minimum, and maximum) for ht. Interpret these statistics.

## Question #2

Draw a scatterplot of ht versus fev. Place ht on the x-axis and fev on the y-axis. Interpret this plot.

## Question #3

Calculate the correlation between ht and fev. Interpret this correlation.

## Question #4

Calculate counts and percentages for sex. Please be sure to convert sex from the numeric codes into a factor. Interpret these statistics.

## Question #5

Draw a boxplot for sex and fev. Interpret this boxplot.

## Question #6

Calculate the difference in average fev values between males and females. Is this a large or a small difference? Calculate the effect size by dividing by the standard deviation of the females. Is this a small, medium, or large effect size?

## Question #7

Use the simon-5501-04-gardasil.qmd file. Summarize and interpret the percentage of patients receiving medical assistance. Be sure to convert the number codes for this variable into labels using the factor function.

## Question #8

Draw a bar chart showing the percentages for number of shots received by whether the patient received medical assistance. Interpret this chart.

## Your submission

-   Save the output in html format
-   Convert it to pdf format.
-   Make sure that the pdf file includes
    -   Your last name
    -   The number of this course
    -   The number of this module
-   Upload the file

## If it doesn't work

If your program has any errors or fails to produce the output that you desire and you can't resolve the problem,  upload the program file along with the pdf file to help us figure out what went wrong. You will get a chance to resubmit the assignment if needed.
