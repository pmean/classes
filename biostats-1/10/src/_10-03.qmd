## Important assumptions

-   Same as independent-samples t-test
    -   Normality
    -   Equal variances
    -   Independence
-   Note: unequal sample sizes is not a violation of assumptions
    -   But does lead to some tedious complications

## How to check for non-normality

-   Boxplots
    -   Look for evidence of skewness or outliers
    
## How to check for heterogeneity

-   Descriptive statistics
    -   Look for one standard deviation much larger than another
-   Boxplots
    -   Look for one box that is much wider than another
    
##  How to check for independence 

-   Qualitative assessment of how data was collected

## Optional: analysis of residuals, 1

-   Predicted value, $\hat{Y}_{ij}$
    -   $\hat{Y}_{ij} = \bar{Y}_i$
-   Residual, $e_{ij}$
    -   $e_{ij}$= Observed - Predicted
    -   $e_{ij}= Y_{ij}-\hat{Y}_{ij}$
    -   $e_{ij}= Y_{ij}-\bar{Y}_i$

## Optional: analysis of residuals, 2

-   Normal probability plot (QQ plot) of residuals
-   Histogram of residuals
-   Plot predicted values versus residuals.
