## Review multiple comparisons issue

-   Type I error: rejecting the null hypothesis when the null hypothesis is true.
    -   Multiple simultaneous hypotheses increase the Type I error rate.
-   $E_1$ = Type I error for Hypothesis 1
-   $E_2$ = Type I error for Hypothesis 2
    -   $P[E_1\ \cup\ E_2]=P[E_1]+P[E_2]-P[E_1\ \cap\ E_2]$
    -   $P[E_1\ \cup\ E_2]\ \le\ P[E_1]+P[E_2]$
    -   $P[E_1\ \cup\ E_2]\ \le\ 2 \alpha$

## Tukey post hoc tests

-   If you reject H0, which values are unequal
    -   With k groups, there are k(k-1)/2 comparisons
-   Studentized range (Tukey test)
    -   Requires equal sample sizes per group
    -   Uses harmonic mean approximation for unequal sample sizes.
        -   Do not use harmonic means if seriously different sample sizes.

## Alternatives to Tukey post hoc tests

-   Bonferroni adjustment
    -   Works for unequal sample sizes per group
    -   Works for unequal variances
-   Dunnett's test
    -   Treatment versus multiple controls
-   Scheffe's test
    -   Works for complex comparison
        -   Example $\mu_1\ vs.\ \frac{\mu_2+\mu_3+\mu_4}{3}$

## Bonferroni adjustment

-   For m hypotheses
    -   $P[E_1\ \cup\ ...\ \cup E_m]\ \le\ m \alpha$
-   Test each hypothesis at $\alpha/m$
    -   Preserves overall Type I error rate
-   Example, 3 simultaneous hypotheses
    -   Reject H0 if p-value \< 0.0133

## Controversies over Tukey/Bonferroni adjustment

-   Increases Type II errors
-   Impractical for large values of m
-   Works poorly for highly correlated tests
-   Ambiguity in definition of "simultaneous" hypotheses

## Special case alternatives to Bonferroni/Tukey adjustment

-   False discovery rate
-   Designation of primary and secondary outcomes
-   Subjective assessment of simultaneous hypotheses
