## Question 1

Compare the average hcb concentrations between the surface, middepth and bottom sampling locations using analysis of variance. Be sure to include appropriate descriptive statistics and graphs. Comment on the assumptions needed for this test, but do not conduct any alternative analyses. If there is a statistically significant difference among the three means, use the Tukey post-hoc comparison to identify where the differences lie.

## Question 2

You want to run a sample size calculation for a replication of this experiment using hcb as the outcome measure. Assume that the sample means for hcb are similar at surface and middepth, but higher at the bottom (4.8 for the surface, 4.8 for middepth, and 5.2 for the bottom). What sample size would you need to achieve 90% power at an alpha level of 0.05.
