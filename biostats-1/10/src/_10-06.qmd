## Using the power.anova.test function to estimate sample size

-   *power.anova.test*
    -   *groups* is the number of groups
    -   *n* is the number of observations per group
    -   *between.var* is the estimate of MSTR
    -   *within.var* is the estimate of MSE
    -   *sig.level* is the alpha level
    -   *power* is the power
-   Set *n=NULL* to estimate sample size
    
## What if n is outside your budget?

-   Increase between.var
-   Increase Type I error rate (sig.level)
-   Increase Type II error rate (decrease power)
-   Decrease number of groups
