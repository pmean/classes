I decided that I need to stop swimming against the tide and work with the recent AI systems that produce interesting narrative text. So I turned on the AI Companion that is associated with Zoom and asked it to provide a detailed summary of the synchronous Zoom session for module 13. Here is what it produced. I made some light editing changes. In particular, AI companion had footnotes associated with each key topic that would let you review the portion of the transcript of the Zoom session associated with that topic. I removed those footnotes because they could not be captured in the dump of the AI companion output into this document.

I think that a lot of the recent AI innovations have been over-hyped, but there is some value in their use. And although AI is a ravenous consumer of electrical power, the cost is in the initial training. An actual application like this one is not that computationally intensive. So here is what AI companion thinks are the important points of the Zoom session.

There was nothing in the summary that would raise any privacy issues, but if there were, I would modify the summary to hide personal details.

## AI Companion summary

This was Module 13 of MEDB 5501, a synchronous Zoom session taught by Stephen. The session focused on 2x2 cross-tabulations and various statistical tests for analyzing binary data.

Key Topics Covered:

-   2x2 Cross-Tabulations
-   Introduction using Titanic dataset (1,313 passengers)
-   Multiple ways to display the same data (8 different orientations)
-   Row, column, and cell percentages
-   Importance of rounding to two significant figures for readability
-   Statistical Tests for Two Proportions
-   Binomial distribution fundamentals
-   Test of equality of two proportions using Z-test
-   Discussion of Yates continuity correction (Stephen doesn't recommend it)
-   Chi-squared test of independence
-   Fisher's exact test for small samples
-   Sample Size Calculations
-   Power calculations for binary outcomes using power.prop.test
-   Rule of 50: need 25-50 events per group for adequate power
-   Sample sizes often require hundreds to thousands of participants
-   Effect Measures
-   Odds ratios calculation and interpretation
-   Relative risk (risk ratios) calculations
-   Conversion between odds and probabilities
-   Multiple ways to orient and interpret results
-   R Programming
-   Extensive R code demonstrations using EpiTools package
-   Cross-tabulation with xtabs function
-   Proportion calculations and visualizations
-   Implementation of all discussed statistical tests
-   Homework Assignment
-   Three questions analyzing third-class passengers on Titanic
-   Creating binary variable for passenger class
-   Comparing survival probabilities between groups
-   Stephen emphasized that while multiple analytical approaches exist for 2x2 tables, logistic regression (Module 14's topic) is generally preferred for more complex analyses.
