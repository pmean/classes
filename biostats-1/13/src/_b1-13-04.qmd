## What you need for a continuous outcome

-   Research hypothesis
-   Standard deviation of your outcome measure
-   Minimum clinically important difference
-   Other details
    -   Type I error rate (usually 0.05)
    -   Power (usually 0.90)

:::notes
In an earlier lecture, you saw that a sample size calculation needed three major elements, a research hypothesis, a standard deviation, and the minimum clinically important difference.

That's not all, but the Type I error rate or alpha is usually fixed at 0.05. Power is usually fixed at 0.9. You might go a bit lower, but don't go much lower than 0.8 for power. It might be okay from your perspective, but power around 0.75 or less is considered a red flag by those who might examine your research (IRB members, granting agencies, journal peer reviewers).

## What you need for a categorical outcome

-   Research hypothesis
-   Expected proportion in the control group
-   Minimum clinically important difference

:::notes
The elements that you need when you have a categorical outcome change a bit. Instead of a standard deviation, you need to specify the expected proportion of events in the control group.

## Hypothetical scenario, 1

-   Weight loss study
    -   Control is recommended diet and exercise routine
    -   Treatment adds experimental weight loss drug
    -   Binary event, losing at least 5 pounds after 6 months
-   Hypothesis proportion is higher in treatment group than control
-   Proportion in control group is 10%
-   Need to see at least 5% more events in treatment group

## Hypothetical scenario, 2

-   Set power to 90%
-   Set Type I error rate (alpha) to 5%

```{r}
#| label: 13-04-power
#| echo: true

power.prop.test(
	p1=0.10, 
	p2=0.15, 
	power=0.9,
	sig.level=0.05)
```

## Rule of 50 

-   Want to detect a doubling or halving
-   Need 25 to 50 events in each group
-   Example
    -   Control probability is 0.1
    -   Want to see 20% in treatment group
    -   25/0.1 = 250; 50/0.1 = 500
