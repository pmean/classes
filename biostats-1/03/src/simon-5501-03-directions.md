## Download programs

Download two program templates:

-   [simon-5501-03-normal-calculations.qmd][sim1]
-   [simon-5501-03-fev.qmd][sim2]

[sim1]: https://github.com/pmean/classes/blob/master/biostats-1/03/src/simon-5501-03-normal-calculations.qmd
[sim2]: https://github.com/pmean/classes/blob/master/biostats-1/03/src/simon-5501-03-fev.qmd

and store them in your src folder.

## Download data

Also download the data file:

-   [fev.csv][sim3]

[sim3]: https://github.com/pmean/data/blob/main/files/fev.csv

and store it in your data folder. You may wish to review the data dictionary

-   [fev.yaml][sim4]

[sim4]: https://github.com/pmean/data/blob/main/files/fev.yaml

## Question #1

Use the  simon-5501-03-normal-calculations.qmd file. Update the program to calculate P[-1 < Z < 1]. Interpret this probability.

## Question #2

Update the program to calculate the 60th percentile of a standard normal distribution.

## Question #3

Use the fev dataset to assess the normality of ht. Draw two histograms--one with a small number of bars and another with a large number of narrow bars. Note that the binwidth valuess will not be the same those used for fev. Is your interpretation similar for both histograms?

## Question #4

Draw a normal probability plot for ht. Interpret this plot.

## Your submission

-   Save the output in html format
-   Convert it to pdf format.
