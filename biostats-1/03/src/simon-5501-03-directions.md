## Question #1

Use the  simon-5501-03-normal-calculations.qmd file. Update the program to calculate P[-1 < Z < 1]. Interpret this probability.

## Question #2

Update the program to calculate the 60th percentile of a standard normal distribution.

## Question #3

Use the fev dataset to assess the normality of ht. Draw two histograms--one with a small number of bars and another with a large number of narrow bars. Note that the binwidth valuess will not be the same those used for fev. Is your interpretation similar for both histograms?

## Question #4

Draw a normal probability plot for ht. Interpret this plot.
