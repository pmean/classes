## Interpret the output

I provided an interpretation for mean
price. Provide a similar interpretation 
for the other three means. Be sure to

-   use a descriptive name
-   include the units of measurement, if appropriate
-   round to two or three significant digits
-   use comma separators for numbers 1,000 or larger

## Your submission

-   Save the output in html format
-   Convert it to pdf format.

## If it doesn't work

If your program has any errors or fails
to produce the output that you desire 
and you can't resolve the problem, 
upload the program file along with the
pdf file to help us figure out what 
went wrong. You will get a chance to 
resubmit the assignment if needed.
