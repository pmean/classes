## Standardization of an individual data value

## Standardization of a statistic

General form of standardization

-   $Z\ or\ t = \frac{statistic-parameter}{se(statistic)}$

Specific standardization for the mean

-   $Z\ or\ t = \frac{\bar{X}-\mu}{se(\bar{X})}$

::: notes

## Convert this to a confidence interval

-   $P[-t(\alpha/2; n-1) < \frac{\bar{X}-\mu}{se(\bar{X})} < t(\alpha/2; n-1)] = 1-\alpha$

-   $P[-t(\alpha/2; n-1)se(\bar{X}) < \bar{X}-\mu < t(\alpha/2; n-1)se(\bar{X})] = 1-\alpha$

-   $P[\bar{X}-t(\alpha/2; n-1)se(\bar{X}) < \mu < \bar{X} + t(\alpha/2; n-1)se(\bar{X})] = 1-\alpha$

If n \> 30

-   $P[\bar{X}-Z(\alpha/2)se(\bar{X}) < \mu < \bar{X} + Z(\alpha/2)se(\bar{X})] \approx 1-\alpha$

::: notes

## Intepretation

If n \< 30, we have 1-$\alpha$ level of confidence that the population mean lies between

-   $\bar{X}-t(\alpha/2; n-1)se(\bar{X})$ and
-   $\bar{X}+t(\alpha/2; n-1)se(\bar{X})$

If n \> 30, we have 1-$\alpha$ level of confidence that the population mean lies between

-   $\bar{X}-Z(\alpha/2)se(\bar{X})$ and
-   $\bar{X}+Z(\alpha/2)se(\bar{X})$

## Other forms of the confidence interval

-   Simpler (too simple?)
    -   $\bar{X}-2\ se(\bar{X})$ and
    -   $\bar{X}+2\ se(\bar{X})$ and
-   Use $t(\alpha/2; n-1)$ even if n \> 30
-   Do not use these alternate forms for your homework.

## Confidence interval for Ease Score

-   Calculations
    -   $se(\bar{X})=\frac{8.23}{\sqrt{14}}=2.19956$
    -   $t(0.025, 13) = 2.16$
    -   $46.94 - 2.16 \times 2.19956=42.18895$
    -   $46.94 + 2.16 \times 2.19956=51.69105$
-   We are 95% confident that the population mean reading age of ChatGPT education guides is between 42 and 52.

::: notes
The ease score represents ease of reading with larger values representing better readability. AQ value of 30 was cited as representing difficult to read text based on a review of editorials in popular Indian medical journals.
:::

## Confidence interval for overall similarity

-   Calculations
    -   $se(\bar{X})=\frac{11.46}{\sqrt{14}}=3.062814$
    -   $t(0.025, 13) = 2.16$
    -   $27.07 - 2.16 \times 7.234762=20.45432$
    -   $27.07 + 2.16 \times 3.062814=33.68568$
-   We are 95% confident that the population mean similarity is between 20% and 34%.

::: notes
The similarity score is used for plagiarism checks. A value of 15% or more is taken by some resources as concerning.

## Effect sizes

-   Cohen's d = $\frac{\bar{X}-C}{se(\bar{X})}$
-   Useful for
    -   Systematic overviews
    -   Intermediate calculation in sample size formulas
-   Critcisms
    -   Clinical relevance requires units of measure
    -   Small, medium, large are arbitrary labels

::: notes
The effect size for a sample mean is calculated by subtracting the hypothesized mean, C, from the sample mean and dividing by the standard error of the mean.

The use of effect sizes is controversial. Monica Gaddis loves them, other faculty in our department love them. I hate them.

They are okay for systematic overviews and as an intermediate calculation in sample size formulas.

But I do not like to see them reported in journal articles. Using terms like small, medium, or large is very arbitrary and does not translate well from one discipline to another. I also believe that unitless quantities provide no help in deciding whether a result has clinical relevance.

There's a joke I tell about this. A store displays a huge banner at their entrance. The banner reads "Big sale! All prices reduced by half a standard deviation."

Even though I dislike effect sizes, I feel the obligation to teach them because they are used by many researchers.

This file was downloaded from the DASL (Data and Story Library) website. There are no details about who created the data set or what permissions are allowed. Educational uses of this data are probably allowed under the Fair Use provisions of U.S. Copyright Law.

This is a tab delimited data file. There are 50 rows and 2 columns of data.

The first variable is the sample number (1 to 50). The second variable is the circumference of the baseball in inches. The variable names are included at the top of the data.

::: notes

## Baseball data dictionary (2/2)

The first variable is the sample number (1 to 50). The second variable is the circumference of the baseball in inches. The variable names are included at the top of the data.

The standard sized baseball, according to Wikipedia and other sources on the Internet is 9 to 9.25 inches. There are no missing values in this data set.

## Approximate confidence interval

-   Note that $se(\bar{X}) \approx 0.007$
    -   9.118 - 0.014 = 9.104
    -   9.118 + 0.014 = 9.132

::: notes
You can get an approximate 95% confidence interval using the plus or minus two standard errors rule. The standard error is roughly 0.007. Two standard errors would be roughly 0.014. Subtracting and adding from the mean provides an approximate confidence interval of 9.104 to 9.132.

## Converting the SPSS confidence interval

-   We are 95% confident that $\mu-9.125$ is between -.02150 and 0.00658.
    -   Add 9.125 to both sides.
    -   -0.02150 + 9.125 = 9.10350
    -   0.00658 + 9.125 = 9.13158
-   Always round at the end.
    -   We are 95% confidence that the population mean circumference is between 9.10 and 9.13.

::: notes
I am not a big fan of effect sizes, but I am in a minority perspective here. Life is too short to worry about Cohen's d versus the Hedges correction. Both indicate a small effect size (less than 0.2).
