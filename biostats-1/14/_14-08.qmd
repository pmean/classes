## Model

-   $Y_i=\beta_0+\beta_1 X_{1i}+\beta_2 X_{2i}+\epsilon_i$
-   Least squares estimates: $b_0,\ b_1,\ b_2$

Add note.

## Interpretations

-   $b_0$ is the estimated average value of Y when X1 and X2 both equal zero.
-   $b_1$ is the estimated average change in Y
    -   when $X_1$ increases by one unit, and
    -   $X_2$ is held constant
-   $b_2$ is the estimated average change in Y
    -   when $X_2$ increases by one unit, and
    -   $X_1$ is held constant
    
## Unadjusted relationship between height and FEV

```{r}
library(broom)
library(tidyverse)
fn <- "../data/data-05-fev.csv"
read_csv(fn, col_names=FALSE) %>%
  data.frame -> init
names(init) <- c(
  "age",
  "fev",
  "height",
  "sex",
  "smoker")
lm(fev~height, data=init) %>%
  tidy %>%
  pull(estimate) -> bu
ggplot(init, aes(height, fev, label=age)) +
  geom_text() +
  geom_abline(slope=bu[2], intercept=bu[1])
```

## Relationship between height and FEV controlling at Age=3

    ggplot(aes(height, fev, label=age)) +
      geom_text(color=co[o]) +
      geom_abline(slope=b[2], intercept=b[1]+b[3]*a) +
