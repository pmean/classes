## The population model

-   $Y_i=\beta_0+\beta_1 X_i + \epsilon_i,\ i=1,...,N$
    -   $\epsilon_i$ is an unknown random variable
        -    Mean 0, standard deviation, $\sigma$
        -    Often assumed to be normal
    -   $\beta_0$ and $\beta_1$ are unknown parameters
    -   $b_0$ and $b_1$ are estimates from the sample

## Least squares principle (1/3)

```{r}
draw_line(20, 1)

## Least squares principle (2/3)

```{r}
draw_line(10, 1)

```

## Least squares principle (3/3)

```{r}
draw_line(30, -1)

```

## Violations of this model

-   Nonlinearity
-   Heterogeneity
-   Non-normality
-   Lack of independence
