This is adapted from a grading rubric
used in my Introduction to SAS class.

+ Filename and format (2 points) Required elements: Your last name, class number, module number, single file in pdf format

  + Poor (0 points): Missing two or more required elements
  + Fair (1 point): Missing only one required element
  + Good (2 points): Includes all required elements
    + Note: although it is not recommended, you can submit your assignment as multiple pdf files without penalty.

+ Documentation header (2 points) Required elements: Author, creation date, purpose, permissions
  + Poor (0 points): Missing two or more required elements
  + Fair (1 point): Missing only one required element
  + Good (2 points): Includes all required elements

+ Readability. I am not grading on the readability of your code. Nevertheless, if you use a program other than SPSS, I strongly encourage you to use line breaks, indents, and vertical lists to make your code more readable.

+ Accuracy (6 points)
  + Poor (0 points): Three or more major errors or omissions
  + Fair (2 points): Two major errors or omissions
  + Good (4 points): Two minor errors or one major error or omission
  + Excellent (6 points): Complete and accurate answers to all questions
