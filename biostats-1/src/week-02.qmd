### August 23 email inquiry

![Screenshot from an email message](../images/email-2023-08-23){#fig-email fig-align="left"}

:::notes
I am sharing an email that I got a few days ago. I love email inquiries like this, with one exception.

This was a question about the content of this course and the sender included Ricardo Moniz in the CC line. Now some of you know Ricardo and he is a great resource for many things. I myself rely on him for many questions. But please don't include him on questions regarding the content of this course.

Ricardo is available to answer all sorts of administrative questions. That keeps him pretty busy. Now he actually did answer this question before I did, and he didn't really mind. Let's save questions for Ricardo that relate to administrative issues, such as how to switch from the synchronous version of this class to the asynchronous version.

On a related note, please send any questions about grading to me rather than to Xi Wang. I am in constant contact with her and I share with her how I want to grade things. So if you don't like how something was graded, your beef is with me.

Now I don't want you to ever feel that you can't complain about grades. That's something that goes with the job. Just be sure that I'm the one that gets the complaint and not Xi Wang.

Thanks!
