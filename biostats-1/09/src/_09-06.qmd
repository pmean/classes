## Paired data

-   Sometimes you collect data in pairs
    -   Drug for left arm, placebo for right arm
    -   Measure patient before intervention and after
    -   Each exposed patient matched on age/sex with control
    
:::notes
There are lots of situations where the two groups in a research study are paired together. In this case, the test changes

## Calculate differences

-   $D_i = X_{1i}-X_{2i}$
    -   $\bar{D}=\frac{1}{n} \Sigma D_i$
    -   $S_D=\sqrt{\frac{1}{n-1} \Sigma (D_i-\bar{D})^2}$

## Test of hypothesis

-   $H_0:\ \mu_D = 0$
-   $H_1:\ \mu_D \ne 0$
    -   T = $\frac{\bar{D}}{se}
        -   se = \frac{S_D}{\sqrt{n}}
-   Accept $H_0$ if T is close to zero.

## Confidence interval

-   $\bar{D} \pm t(1-\alpha/2) se$
    -   Range of plausible values for $\mu_D$
    
## Assumptions of paired t-test

-   Normality
-   Independence
-   Heterogeneity is not an issue
