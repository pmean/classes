### Module03-Reading text files

Much of the data you will analyze in R comes from plain text files. These files come in a variety of forms. This module will show you how to read some of the more common forms of text data into R.

**If you've already found a dataset for use in the final project, take a look at the form that your data comes in. Is it fixed width? Is it delimited? What are the delimiters? Does your data include variable lines at the top of the text file? See if you can successfully read your data into R.**
