### Module02-Data with mostly continuous variables

If your data consists of mostly continuous variables, you should summarize your data using means, standard deviations, and ranges. You should look for extreme values (outliers) in your data. Your graphical displays should include histograms and scatterplots. This module will cover how to produce these using R.

**At the end of this class, you need to run a final project using a dataset that has not been used in this class. It's not too early to start looking for something. Try to find a dataset that is large enough to allow for a some interesting graphs and tables, but not so large that it takes an excessive amount of time. If you can't find such a dataset, I have several that I can share with you.**
