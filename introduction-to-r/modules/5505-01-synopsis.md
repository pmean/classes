### Module01-Getting started

You should start out slowly. You will learn how to set up the recommended directory structure and get a simple R program to run. You will also provide reasonable documentation for your program and learn how to use good coding style.

**Although I am giving you a lot of time, please don't delay on this first homework assignment. Getting a program to run--any program can be the hardest part of this class. Everything is new and there are a lot of subtle details that are easy to overlook. Try your best, but if you can't get the basic program to work, set up an appointment to talk to me.**
