## Tab delimited files

```{r}
#| label: setup-03
#| echo: false

load("../data/module03.RData")
```

`r simple_tab`

::: notes

Tabs are little bit different and you might want to listen to the live video where I show how the tab key works.

Type the following into notepad and what appears to be multiple blanks, I want you to press the tab key, but only once.

## Using the read_tsv function

`r read_tab`

::: notes

The read_tsv function works when you have a tab character as the delimiter. It uses the same arguments as the read_csv function.
