## Anything can be a delimiter

```{r}
#| label: setup-04
#| echo: false

load("../data/module03.RData")
```

`r simple_tilde`

::: notes

Type in the same data, but using the tilde (~) as a separator (e.g., 1~4). Save the file as tilde.txt.

Here is how you would use read_delim to read this file.

:::

## Using the read_delim function with delim="~"

`r read_tilde`

::: notes

The data reads in just fine. Why would you use a tilde as a delimiter? Sometimes your data itself includes delimiters like spaces and commas, and then you might want to choose an obscure out of the way symbol to serve as a delimiter.

Another obscure character that is sometimes used as a delimiter is the vertical bar (|).
