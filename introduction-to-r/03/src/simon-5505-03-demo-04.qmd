## File details

This program reads data from a text file with the tilde character (~) as a delimiter. It was written by Steve Simon on 2025-01-06 and is placed in the public domain. You can use this program any way you please.

The data itself is small and artificial, so there is no need for a data dictionary.

```{r}
#| label: setup
#| message: false
#| warning: false

R.version.string
Sys.Date()
library(tidyverse)
```

## Read in data

```{r}
#| label: read-tilde

raw_data <- read_delim(
  file="../data/tilde.txt",
  delim="~",
  col_names=TRUE,
  col_types="nn")

glimpse(raw_data)
```

#### Comments on the code

The [read_delim][ref01] function is described in the same page that describes the read_csv  and read_tsv functions.
