## Question 1

There is an unusually low value for ht, 29.5 inches. Display information about the case, age, wt, ht, and bmi for this person (but no other variables). Do you think this is a legitimate value?

## Question 2

Calculate the mean, standard deviation, minimum, and maximum values for age and bmi. Round the values appropriately. Interpret these numbers.

## Question 3

The data dictionary implies that there are no missing values in the dataset. Write some code that checks whether this is true or not. Display the missing value counts in a vertical format.

## Grading rubric

You will be evaluated using the [general grading rubric for programming assignments][refp4].
