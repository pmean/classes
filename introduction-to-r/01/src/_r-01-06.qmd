## Data dictionary (1/3)

![Data dictionary for two-small-dateframes](../images/data-dictionary-01.png)

<div class="notes">

Let me take a break here and mention the data dictionaries that you can consult for this program. There are three, actually, that are relevant here. I have links to all three data dictionaries on the Canvas site.

The first is a data dictionary for two-small-data-frames.RData. It notes that this file contains information documented in airline-data-dictionary.yaml and fat-data-dictionary.yaml.

## Data dictionary (2/3)

Here is just a partial listing of the data dictionary for bump.

## Data dictionary (3/3)

<div class="notes">

Here is a partial listing of the data dictionary for fat. It is probably a bit of overkill to provide this much documentation, but I want to set a good example throughout this class. If you cannot find a data dictionary for any dataset used in this class, or if the data dictionary is missing important information, please let me know right away.

By the way, even though it is a lot of extra work, I have found that I get fewer questions from students when I include data dictionaries as part of any class that I teach.
