This program was written by Steve Simon created on 2019-01-28 with a major
revision on 2024-12-27 to illustrate the structure of an R program. This program
is in the public domain. You can use it any way that you please.

```{r}
#| label: setup
#| message: false
#| warning: false

R.version.string
Sys.Date()
library(tidyverse)
```

Read data from the aids-cases text file. This file is described at

https://github.com/pmean/data/blob/main/files/aids-cases.yaml

```{r}
#| label: read-text-file

aids_cases <- read_csv(
  file="../data/aids-cases.csv",
  col_types="nnn")
glimpse(aids_cases)
```

This is a small dataset with only three variables.

```{r}
#| label: line-graph

aids_cases |>
  ggplot() +
    aes(yr, nsw) +
    geom_line()
```

There is an increasing trend in aids cases in New South Wales over time.
