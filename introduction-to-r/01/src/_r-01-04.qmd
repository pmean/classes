## Anatomy of a small R program, overview

![](../images/structure-of-r-program-01.png "Program with components labelled")

::: notes

This is a full listing of a small program written in Rmarkdown. The font is too small to read. Don't worry, I just wanted you to see the full picture. I'll look at small pieces of this program using a readable font size.

## Anatomy of a small R program, header

```{r}
#| label: overview
#| echo: false
#| comment: ""
#| message: false
#| warning: false

library(stringr)

tx <- readLines("simon-5505-01-small-program.qmd")
header_lines <- str_which(tx, "---")
backtick_lines <- str_which(tx, "``")
eof_line <- length(tx)
beg_line <- header_lines[1]
end_line <- header_lines[2]

cat(paste0(tx[beg_line:end_line], collapse="\n"))
```

::: notes

All right, The first thing we have is the header. The header uses a structure called YAML (Y-A-M-L). YAML is a special type of up format that is used by lots of programmers. The header provides a bit of information about the about the program. The default option when you start up a new R Markdown file is to list, the title, author, date, and output format.

I find the word "date" by itself ambiguous, so I add the word "Created" to distinguish the creation date from the last modified date. It is not easy to track the last modified date in RStudio.

R Markdown has options for creating web pages (html documents). You can also produce Word documents and PDF documents. I should warn you that creating PDF documents directly is a bit tricky. You need to have a program called LaTeX (pronounced lay-tech) installed first.

You can also produce Powerpoint files, which this is an example of.

The default is HTML and that's a pretty good format. Quite honestly, I've got a lot of mileage out of HTML

## Anatomy of a small program, free text comments

```{r}
#| label: free-text-1
#| echo: false
#| comment: ""
#| 
beg_line <- end_line+1
end_line <- backtick_lines[1]-1
cat(paste0(tx[beg_line:end_line], collapse="\n"))
```

::: notes

Here's a brief sentence written as open text. You will be required to provide open text comments on all your homework assignments. Often just a single sentence will do, but do get in the practice of interspersing open text comments throughout your code.

## Anatomy of a small program, code chunk

```{r}
#| label: chunk-1
#| echo: false
#| comment: ""

beg_line <- end_line+1
end_line <- backtick_lines[2]
cat(paste0(tx[beg_line:end_line], collapse="\n"))
```

::: notes

in R Markdown, sections of R code are delineated with three backticks. The backtick is a leftward slanting single quote mark. For most keyboards, you will find the backtick key on the top row, just to the left of the "1" key.

The beginning of a chunk of R code has three backticks, followed by a left curly bracket, the letter "r" and then an optional name. End with a right curly bracket.

This program chunk includes two lines of code.

R.version.string displays the version of R that you are running. You should try to use a version of R at 4.0 or higher. This would only be an issue if you've been using R for more than a couple of years and have been lazy about upgrades. If you downloaded R at the beginning of this semester, you will have a version of R beyond 4.0.

The second line of code, Sys.Date(), displays the current date. Sometimes knowing when a program was run can help you decide if you need to run the program again (perhaps because the data has changed, or you are using a new version of R).

After this you see three more backticks, which tells R Markdown that the chunk of code has ended.

I recommend that you try to avoid long stretches of R code. Break it up into segments of no more than 20 lines of code, and often less than this is better. Working with your program in chunks and interspersing free text comments liberally makes it easier to maintain your code.

## Anatomy of a small program, second set of free text comments

```{r}
#| label: free-text-2
#| echo: false
#| comment: ""
 
beg_line <- end_line+1
end_line <- backtick_lines[3]-1
cat(paste0(tx[beg_line:end_line], collapse="\n"))
```

::: notes

Here's another brief comment. Note that you write an R Markdown a bit differently than most other programs. Most other programs place the comments inside of special delimiters. In SAS, for example, you start a comment with a slash and an asterisk and end it with an asterisk and a slash.

In R Markdown, the comments are not delimited. The code is delimited by three consecutive backticks.

:::

## Anatomy of a small program, second code chunk

```{r}
#| label: chunk-2
#| echo: false
#| comment: ""
 
beg_line <- end_line+1
end_line <- backtick_lines[4]
cat(paste0(tx[beg_line:end_line], collapse="\n"))
```

::: notes

Here's some more R code. I named the chunk "read-rdata-file". The load function reads information from a file named ../data.two-small-dataframes.RData.

I have to apologize here because Powerpoint splits the load function onto two consecutive lines, making it a bit harder to read.

The second line of code is the ls function. Just ls with a left and a right parenthesis. This function lists everything that you have either loaded or created within R. In this case, it is just the information that we got from the two-small-dataframes.RData file.

There are two objects, bump and fat. These are actually dataframes, the standard way that R stores data. If you look on my github site, you will find data dictionaries for these two dataframes.

The head function lists the first few lines of ant object in R. In this case, it will show the first six lines of the dataframe bump.

## Anatomy of a small program, third set of free text comments

```{r}
#| label: free-text-3
#| echo: false
#| comment: ""
 
beg_line <- end_line+1
end_line <- eof_line
cat(paste0(tx[beg_line:end_line], collapse="\n"))
```

::: notes

After the second chunk of R code, I add a couple of extra comments.

It's very simple program but if you can get this program to run, you probably have smooth sailing for the rest of the class. I really believe that installing the software is often tricky. Getting the first program to run is often tricky. But once you get those going then you keep on modifying. Just make tiny changes to the programs you already have. It will either work or there will be an obvious error that you can fix.

The problem is getting the first program will run. Once you get one program that works, the rest is downhill.

I need to emphasize here very strongly if you're having problems. Come and see me right away. Drop me an email. Try to visit. I do not have official office hours, but I will make appointments at any reasonable time for people to come and talk.

## Anatomy of a small program, review

![](../images/structure-of-r-program-01.png "Program with components labelled")

::: notes

Here is the full program again. You can see that it starts with a header, and alternates between free text and R code.

I like this structure a lot because it allows you to liberally comment your code. Comments are easy. I'm not the best at using good programming practices, but the one thing I am rabid about is I try to put in a lot of documentation. It takes time, but usually pays off.
