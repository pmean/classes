## Barplot of counts, code

```{r barplot1}
simple_barplot <- 
  ggplot(ti, aes(x=PClass)) + 
    geom_bar()
ggsave(
  "../images/barplot1.png", 
  simple_barplot)
```

::: notes

I'm not a big fan of bar plots, but they sometimes have their uses. You can get a barplot for the frequency count.

Because of the way Rmarkdown displays graphs, I have to put the code on a separate slide from the graph.

## Barplot of percentages, code

```{r barplot2}
percentages_barplot <- 
  ggplot(ti, aes(x=PClass)) + 
    geom_bar(aes(weight=100/n))
ggsave(
  "../images/barplot2.png", 
  percentages_barplot)
```

::: notes

Use weights to get a bar chart of percentages.

## Barplot of percentages, code

```{r barplot3}
labeled_barplot <- 
  percentages_barplot +
    scale_y_continuous(
      "Percent", 
      breaks=c(0, 20, 40), 
      labels=c("0%", "20%", "40%"))
ggsave(
  "../images/barplot3.png", 
  labeled_barplot)
```

::: notes

You can control how the y-axis is labeled with the scale_y_continuous function.
