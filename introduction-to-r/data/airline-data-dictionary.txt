airline-bumping-2017.txt

This file has 12 rows and 5 variables. The variables measures the number of times passengers were "bumped" from an airline flight. Bumping occurs when an airline overbooks reservations for a flight. Normally, the airline will ask for volunteers who will agree to take a later flight in exchange for cash or travel vouchers. But if no one volunteers, airlines will involuntarily bump passengers from the flight.

The data is stored in a text file with tab delimiters. The variable names are listed in the first row.

b2017, number of passengers bumped in 2017
b2016, number of passengers bumped in 2016
r2017, rate of bumping per 10,000 passengers in 2017
r2016, rate of bumping per 10,000 passengers in 2016
