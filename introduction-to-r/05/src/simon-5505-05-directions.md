## Data

-   Download the [albuquerque-housing][ref-abq-nodate-a] data file
    -   Store it in your data folder
-   Refer to the [data dictionary][ref-abq-nodate-b], if needed.

[ref-abq-nodate-a]: https://github.com/pmean/data/blob/main/files/albuquerque-housing.csv
[ref-abq-nodate-b]: https://github.com/pmean/data/blob/main/files/albuquerque-housing.yaml
    
Questions 1-5 refer to the Albuquerque dataset.

1. You will not be graded on this, but get in the habit of computing descriptive statistics for any variable used below.

2. Compute the average age for custom-built and regular houses. Do custom built houses appear to be much newer tahn regular houses?

3. Draw a clustered boxplot comparing prices for custom-built versus regular houses and corner lots versus side lots. The most important comparison is custom-built versus regular houses whether located on corner lots or on side lots. So make sure that the custom-built/regular boxplots appear close to one another.

3. Find the details on the largest custom-built house and the largest regular house.
## Grading rubric

You will be evaluated using the [general grading rubric for programming assignments][ref-simon-nodate-a].
