This program shows how to manipulate a simple set 
of data and produce a few descriptive statistics.

```{r version-and-current-date}
R.version.string
Sys.Date()
```

Load the file d.RData and list its contents.

```{r read}
load("../data/tst2.RData")
ls()
```

Print the data frame "bump."

```{r print}
head(sleep)
```

The str function gives an overview of any R object

```{r str-function}
str(sleep)
```
