This program written in Rmarkdown to read different data sets.

```{r version-and-current-date}
R.version.string
Sys.Date()
```

This program will read in data from 3 different data sets.
We will show first 6 entries of each data set.

1. The oyster data set shows two different computer vision methods that can be used to estimate oyster weight and oyster volume.This is a tab delimited file.
```{r read- oyster_data_file}
fn<-"../dat/oyster.tsv"
mydata1<-read.table(file=fn,header=TRUE,stringsAsFactors=FALSE,sep = "\t")
head(mydata1)

```
2. An experiment with litters of rats is described in rates.cvs file.This is a comma separated text file. Read it into R and print the first six rows of data.
```{r read-rdata-file}
fn<-"../dat/rates.csv"
mydata2<-read.csv(file=fn,stringsAsFactors=FALSE)
head(mydata2)
```
Question # 3
A study of diamond ring prices is described in diamond.text file.This is a fixed width text file. Read it into R and print the first six rows of data.

``````{r read-rdata-file-1}
fn<-"../dat/diamond.txt"
mydata3<-read.fwf(fn,c(9,10))
head(mydata3)
```

## R Markdown

This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:

```{r cars}
summary(cars)
```

## Including Plots

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r pressure, echo=FALSE}
plot(pressure)
```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.
