### What is longitudinal data
+ Definition
  + Measurements taken at different times
+ Closely related datasets
  + Crossover
  + Pre-test/post-test
  + Repeated measures
  + Split plot
  
<div class="notes">

I'm going to use the term "longitudinal" data to designate data sets where a patient is measured at multiple different time points. This encompasses certain other data sets, such as from a crossover, pre-test/post-test, repeated measures, and split plot.

Don't worry about the technical distinctions among these terms. The important thing to know for now is that longitudinal data represents one of the biggest challenges in data management and we will spend most of this section discussing these challenges.

</div>

### Two formats for longitudinal data
+ Short and fat format
  + Many columns
  + Not so many rows
+ Tall and thin format
  + Not so many columns
  + Many rows
  
<div class="notes">

Longitudinal data usually come in one of two specific formats. The first is the short and fat format and the second is the tall and thin format.

</div>

### Example of both formats

<div class="notes">

Normally, you can only find a dataset stored in one of the two formats, but I did find an example of the same dataset being stored in both formats.

</div>

### Short and fat example

![Longitudinal data stored one row per subject](../images/short-and-fat.png)

<div class="notes">

The short and fat format has one row per patient and each successive patient encounter is strung out horizontally.

</div>

### Tall and thin example

![Longitudinal data stores with multiple rows per patient](../images/tall-and-thin.png)

<div class="notes">

The tall and thin format has one row per patient encounter and therefore multiple rows per patient.

</div>

### Which format is better?

+ Short and fat advantages:
  + easy to compute change scores
  + easy to examine correlations over time
  + easy to insure consistency of demographic data
+ Short and fat disadvantages:
  + hard to read because of the excessive need to scroll left and right

<div class="notes">

Both formats have advantages and disadvantages, and you need to know how to create a longitudinal file in either format and how to transform from one format to another.

The short and fat format makes it easy to compute change scores, the difference between a later measurementn and an earlier one. Correlations are also easier.

Because the short and fat format stretches each visits data out to the right, you end up doing a lot of left/right scrolling with this type of file. 

</div>

### Which format is better?

+ Tall and thin advantages:
  + easy to plot longitudinal trends
  + less need for missing value codes
  + easy to read because most scrolling is up and down

+ Tall and thin disadvantages
  + hard to maintain consistency of demographic variables

<div class="notes">

While some statistical tasks are easier with the short and fat format, the one that is usually easier with the tall and thin format is plotting.

If a subject misses a visit, the short and fat visit format makes you put in missing value codes for all the data that was not collected at that time. A tall and thin format is easier because you just leave out the row that corresponds to the missing visit.

The problem with this format is in the repetition that occurs. If you have demographic variables like gender and race, those are listed on each row. This allows an opportunity for mischief, where a patient can have a different gender on different rows.

Here's another interesting data set that you can work with. It comes in a short and fat format.

### Energy dataset (short and fat format)

```{r read-energy}
fi <- "http://www.statsci.org/data/general/energy.txt"
en <- read.table(fi, header=TRUE)
en
```

<div class="notes">

This dataset is small enough that you can safely print out the entire thing.

You can convert this to a tall and thin format by stacking the running, walking, and cycling values in a single column. You'll need a new variable to remind you whether the value you 

</div>

### Converting to tall and thin

```{r gather-2}
library(tidyr)
en_tall <- gather(en, key="activity", value="energy_used", Running, Walking, Cycling)
head(en_tall, 10)
```

<div class="notes">

Gather creates two new variables. The "key" variable is the name of the column where the data value came from and "value" is the data value itself. Any variable or variables left out of the list are treated like an identifier for a particular row.

</div>

### Lineplot

```{r lineplot}
library(ggplot2)
activity_lineplot <- ggplot(en_tall, aes(x=activity, y=energy_used, group=Subject)) +
  geom_line()
ggsave(
  "../images/activity-by-energy.png", 
  activity_lineplot, width=4, height=4)
```

<div class="notes">

One possible graph that could not have done in the short and fat format is a lineplot. The group parameter in the aes function tells R that separate lines are defined for each subject.

</div>

### Lineplot

![Plot showing activity levels by activity](../images/activity-by-energy.png)

<div class="notes">

Here is the graph. Notice the inverted V shape for each line. This shows that running uses the most energy for any individual subject.

### Earthquake dataset

![View of the earthquake dataset](../images/earthquake-view.png)

<div class="notes">

This is clearly a tab delimited file. All of the fields are left justified.

</div>

### Read in the earthquake data

```{r read-earthquake}
fn <- "http://www.statsci.org/data/general/lomaprie.txt"
qu <- read.table(fn,header=TRUE)
head(qu)
```

<div class="notes">

There are measurements at weeks 0, 3, 6, 9, and 12.

</div>

### Gather

```{r gather}
qu$id <- 1:25
qu_tall <- gather(qu, key="time", value="depression", Week0, Week3, Week6, Week9, Week12)
head(qu_tall)
```

<div class="notes">
 
Suggestion: create an id variable with values 1:25 before you convert the format. It is not needed for the boxplots, but if you do anything more complex with this data, you need to know which data in the tall and thin format comes from the first row of the original data set, from the second row, etc.

</div>

### Boxplot

```{r boxplots}
library(ggplot2)
depression_boxplot01 <- ggplot(qu_tall, aes(x=time, y=depression)) +
  geom_boxplot()
ggsave(
  "../images/time-by-depression01.png", 
  depression_boxplot01, width=4, height=4)
```

<div class="notes">

Notice how R orders the weeks. From a strict alphabetical perspective, week12 is between week0 and week3. Here's a fix.

</div>

### Boxplot

![Boxplots showing depression levels over time](../images/time-by-depression01.png)

<div class="notes">

Here is the plot. The order of the weeks is not correct, because week12 appears between week0 and week3. 

There are several ways to fix this.

</div>

### Boxplot

```{r modified-boxplot}
qu_tall$time[qu_tall$time=="Week0"] <- "Week00"
qu_tall$time[qu_tall$time=="Week3"] <- "Week03"
qu_tall$time[qu_tall$time=="Week6"] <- "Week06"
qu_tall$time[qu_tall$time=="Week9"] <- "Week09"
depression_boxplot02 <- ggplot(qu_tall, aes(x=time, y=depression)) +
  geom_boxplot()
ggsave(
  "../images/time-by-depression02.png", 
  depression_boxplot02, width=4, height=4)
```

<div class="notes">

An easy way to fix this is to use two numeric digits, even for weeks that have only a single digit.

</div>

### Boxplot

![Modified boxplots showing depression levels over time](../images/time-by-depression02.png)

<div class="notes">

Here are the boxplots in the proper order. There are changes in depression levels across time, but these changes are small.

### Backpain dataset

+ Backpain data
  + www.pmean.com/introduction-to-r/data/backpain.csv
  
<div class="notes">

Now let's read in a tall and thin format and convert it to a
short and wide format.

</div>

### Backpain dataset

![Data dictionary for backpain dataset](../images/backpain-data-dictionary.png)

<div class="notes">

Here is the data dictionary for the backpain dataset.

</div> 

### Backpain dataset

![Partial view of backpain raw data](../images/backpain-view.png)

<div class="notes">

No question here. This is a comma separated value dataset.

</div>

### Reading in the backpain dataset

```{r read-backpain}
fn <- "http://www.pmean.com/introduction-to-r/data/backpain.csv"
pain <- read.csv(fn, stringsAsFactors=FALSE)
head(pain)
```

<div class="notes">



</div>

### Converting to short and fat

```{r spread-pain}
age_subset <- pain[ , c("Match", "Group", "Age")]
age_fat <- spread(
  data=age_subset, 
  key=Group, 
  value=Age)
head(age_fat)
```

<div class="notes">

The spread function takes a single column of data and spreads it across multiple columns. The first argument is the dataframe that you want to transform. The second argument gives the categorical variable that identifies which new column a particular value goes into. The third argument provides the values that in the original data set sit in a single column and that we now want to spread across multiple columns.

</div>

### Plots of agreement

```{r agreement12}
agreement12_plot <- ggplot(age_fat, aes(x=NoPain, y=Pain)) +
    geom_point() +
    expand_limits(x=c(15, 55), y=c(15, 55)) +
    geom_segment(x=15, y=15, xend=55, yend=55)
ggsave(
  "../images/agreement12.png",
  agreement12_plot, width=4, height=4)
```


<div class="notes">

This code shows the agreement between the ages of the patients in the NoPain group and the patients in the Pain group.

</div>

### Plots of agreement

```{r agreement32}
agreement32_plot <- ggplot(
  age_fat, aes(x=Sedentary, y=Pain)) +
    geom_point() +
    expand_limits(x=c(15, 55), y=c(15, 55)) +
    geom_segment(x=15, y=15, xend=55, yend=55)
ggsave(
  "../images/agreement32.png",
  agreement32_plot, width=4, height=4)
```


<div class="notes">

This code shows a similar plot, the agreement between the ages of the patients in the Sedentary group and the patients in the Pain group.

</div>

### Plots of agreement

![Plot showing agreement in ages between NoPain and Pain](../images/agreement12.png)

<div class="notes">

The agreement is quite good. There is a bit less agreement for older subjects.

</div>


### Plots of agreement

### Break #2

+ What have you learned
  + Converting to short and fat format
+ What is coming next
  + Separating into time constant/time varying tables
  
<div class="notes">

I want to keep these videos short, so let's stop here.

</div>

### One last recommendation
+ Both formats have problems
  + Tall and thin: repetition of demographic information
  + Short and fat: poor handling of missing value
+ Ideal solution: normalization
  + Put time constant data in first table
  + Put time varying data in second table
  
### Balance dataset
+ Short and fat format
  + www.statsci.org/data/oz/ctsibrm.txt
+ Tall and thin format
  + www.statsci.org/data/oz/ctsibuni.txt
+ Look here for context
  + www.statsci.org/data/oz/ctsib.html

<div class="notes">

You saw this data very early in the video.

</div>

### Balance data set: Short and fat format

![Longitudinal data stored one row per subject](../images/short-and-fat.png)

<div class="notes">

Here is the short and fat format again. It has one row per patient and each successive patient encounter is strung out horizontally.

</div>

### Tall and thin example

![Longitudinal data stores with multiple rows per patient](../images/tall-and-thin.png)

<div class="notes">

Here is the tall and thin format again. It has one row per patient encounter and therefore multiple rows per patient.

</div>

### Time constant table

```{r time-constant}
fn <- "http://www.statsci.org/data/oz/ctsibrm.txt"
short_and_fat_data <- read.table(
  fn, header=TRUE, sep="\t", 
  stringsAsFactors=FALSE)
time_constant_list <- 
  c("Subject", "Sex", "Age", "Height", "Weight")
time_constant_data <- 
  short_and_fat_data[ , time_constant_list]
head(time_constant_data)
```

<div class="notes">

The time constant variables are sex, age, height, and weight. You must keep the subject id in this dataset as well because you will need it to link with the time variable data.

</div>

### Time variable table

```{r time-variable}
fn <- "http://www.statsci.org/data/oz/ctsibuni.txt"
tall_and_thin_data <- read.table(
  fn, header=TRUE, sep="\t", 
  stringsAsFactors=FALSE)
time_variable_list <- 
  c("Subject", "Surface", "Vision", "CTSIB")
time_variable_data <- 
  tall_and_thin_data[ , time_variable_list]
head(time_variable_data)
```

<div class="notes">

Pull the time variable data from the tall and thin format.

Update the time constant table only once. Update the time varying table each time you get information at a new patient visit.

Note that this is what you should do before the data is collected. If the data is already collected by someone else, then you have to live with the limitations of whatever format they chose.

</div>

### Summary
+ Two formats
  + Short and fat
  + Tall and thin
+ gather
  + converts to tall and thin
+ spread
  + converts to short and fat
+ Alternative approach
  + Time constant table
  + Time variable table
  
<div class="notes">

We've covered a lot in these videos. There are two formats for longitudinal data. The short and fat format has one row per patient and strings out the data far to the right. The tall and thin format has one row per time point and strings out the data far down.

Use the gather function in the tidyr library to convert from a short and fat format into a tall and thin format. Use the spread function to convert from a tall and thin format to a short and fat format.

From a data management approach, you should consider a database term called normalization. In a longitudinal setting, this simply means putting your time constant data (usually the demographic variables) in a table using the short and fat format (one row per patient). Then put your time varying data in a different table using the tall and thin format (one row per time point).
