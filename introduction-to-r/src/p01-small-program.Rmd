This is a small program written in Rmarkdown to help you get started if you've never written an R program before.

```{r version-and-current-date}
R.version.string
Sys.Date()
```

This program will read in data from an RData file. It will then list all the objects that you just read in, and list the first few lines for one of those objects.

```{r read-rdata-file}
load("../data/two-small-dataframes.RData")
ls()
head(bump)
```

This is a very simple program, but if you can get this program to run, you will probably have smooth sailing for the rest of the class.
