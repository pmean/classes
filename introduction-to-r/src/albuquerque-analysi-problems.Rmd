Put in comments about use of program etc.

```{r setup}
library(tidyverse)
```

Read the data

```{r read-albuquerque-housing}
al <- read_table(
  "../data/albuquerque-housing.txt",
  col_names=TRUE)
head(al)
names(al)
names(al) <- c(
  glimpse(al)
```

Good way to analyze the data.

```{r}
mean(al$"sqft")
```

Bad way to analyze the data

```{r bad}
al$meansqft <- mean(
  al$sqft,
  na.rm-TRUE)
al$meansqft
```
