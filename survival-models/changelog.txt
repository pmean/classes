This files documents major changes to the file structure of this repository.

2018-04-10. I split the survival-lecture-1.Rmd file into two pieces, the original file and survival-lecture-1-supplement.Rmd. The latter contains code that I need to produce graphs for the PowerPoint handout, but which are not really needed by the students to understand the material or to do the homework assignment. I also removed the SAS code that was only needed for PowerPoint graphs. This makes my job easier and allows students to focus on the important content.

2018-06-25. I started the text for one of the blog posts and stored it in the doc folder under the name blog-post-1.txt.
