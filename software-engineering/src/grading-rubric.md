title: General grading rubric

For more details about the items listed below, please see my [programming expectations handout][pro1].

Note: I added a couple of things on 2021-09-27 and clarified them on 2023-02-15. There is a new "conciseness" element. It addresses a concern of mine when students include output that is not needed to answer the homework assignment. It's fine to have an extra page or two that gives, for example, a brief glimpse of the data. Too much irrelevant output  though (use three or more pages as a rough guideline) will cause you to lose you a point or two. An example of poor conciseness is giving every possible correlation coefficient in a large data set rather than the single correlation I asked for. For some data sets, computing every possible correlation could end up wasting a dozen or more pages. I also clarified the "accuracy" element. If you are totally missing something that I asked for, that is just as bad as making a major error.

+ Filename and format (2 points) Required elements: Your last name, class number, module number, single file in pdf format
