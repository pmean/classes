title: General grading rubric
---

For more details about the items listed below, please see my [programming expectations handout][pro1].

Note: I added a couple of things on 2021-09-27. There is a new "conciseness" element. It addresses a concern of mine when students include output that is not needed to answer the homework assignment. An extra page or two of irrelevant output will lose you a point. More than that will lose you two points. An example of poor conciseness is giving every possible correlation coefficient in a large data set rather than the single correlation I asked for. For some data sets, computing every possible correlation could end up wasting a dozen or more pages. I also clarified the "accuracy" element. If you are totally missing something that I asked for, that is just as bad as making a major error. I will apply this new rubric on any assignments due on or after 2021-10-01.

  + Poor (0 points): Code is very difficult to read or output is cluttered with excessively long and unnecessary tables
  + Fair (1 point): Code is readable, but uses poor or inconsistent style or  output includes one or two unnecessary elements
