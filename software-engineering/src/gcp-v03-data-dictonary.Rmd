# This R markdown file will create a Powerpoint presentation. It uses a minimal amount of R code. You do need to have knitr installed, and process of creating a pptx file goes more smoothly if you have RStudio. See the bottom of this program or the very last slide in the Powerpoint presentation for documentation.

+ The data dictionary also includes an entry for each variable with
   + the name of the variable, 
   + a brief description, 
   + range restrictions (if applicable), and 
   + units of measurement (if appropriate).

  + all possible values,
  + with labels for number codes/abbreviations

## Elements of a data dictionary (3/3)
+ A data dictionary does not have to include all of the things I listed above and it can include things that I did not include. Use your best judgement to decide how much to document in the data dictionary.
