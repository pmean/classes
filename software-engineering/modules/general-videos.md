title: "General videos on software engineering"
---

Software engineering is a systematic process used by computer programmers to simplify the process of creating programs while insuring good quality of those programs at the same time. There is an emphasis, in particular, on work done by teams. Recently, statisticians have been adopting the same tools used by software engineers and applying them to the data analysis process. I have developed some videos on software engineering, written from the perspective of a data analyst. The first seven of these videos covers ideas promoted in an article:

Wilson G, Bryan J, Cranston K, Kitzes J, Nederbragt L, Teal TK (2017) Good enough practices in scientific computing. PLoS Comput Biol 13(6): e1005510. Available in [html format][wils01] or [pdf format][wils02].

There are also videos with my own perspective on data dictionaries and good documentation practices.
