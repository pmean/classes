## Course Details	

-   Introduction to R, MEDB 5505 (13189)
-   Credit Hours: 1
-   Modality: Asynchronous online

## Course Description
 
This course provides a working familiarity with R. No advanced programming or statistical analytic skills, other than the ability to create and modify text files are needed. Basic methods for data import, data management, simple graphics, and basic statistical analysis are introduced. Provides student with a firm foundation to address these areas in advanced statistics classes or in the student's research efforts, including thesis/dissertation research. A basic understanding of statistical terminology and a working familiarity with computer-based data files (e.g., Excel) is necessary. A basic understanding of the concepts of computer coding is recommended.

## Learning Outcomes

You will learn how to read data into R from a variety of text formats, how to manipulate data, and how to produce simple tables of descriptive statists and some basic graphs.

## Required and Recommended Materials	

There is no required textbook. Various free Internet resources will be shared with you throughout the class.

Students are NOT expected to have advanced programming or statistical analysis skills. You only need a working familiarity with computers such as

-   creating text files 
-   setting up a subdirectory structure
-   downloading software from the Internet

## Course Scheduling and Assignments

There will be six or seven modules for this class, available every other week throughout the semester. Each module will have links to videos that you should review as well as slides used in those videos. For most modules, you will have to take a quiz, submit a programming assignment, and comment on a discussion board. Other assignments may be added.

There is no final exam in this class. Instead complete a final project that is described on the Canvas website.

## Course Expectations, Course Policies, Requirements and Standards for Student Coursework and Student Behavior

You are expected to do your homework independently. You can seek help from your instructors, from colleagues, or from the Internet to help decode an error message that you don't understand. You can adapt code that you find on the Internet. We recommend that you acknowledge the source for that code in the comments of your program, but this is not required.

## Evaluation and Grading

Students will be required to post messages on the Canvas discussion boards, take brief quizzes on Canvas, and submit homework assignments in PDF format on Canvas. Your work is due on the specified date. We need to keep the class on the same time schedule for a variety of reasons. If illness, family issues, work responsibilities, or other commitments prevent you from completing on time, please contact me before the due date. Late submission without prior notice will receive a one point deduction. If you find yourself repeatedly falling behind on quizzes and assignments, it would be good to set up a meeting to discuss this.

This course is grade Credit/No Credit (Pass/Fail). Students who complete at least 80% of the regular coursework and successfully complete the final project will receive credit for the course.

## Point values for all assignments

+ Discussion boards, 3 points
+ Homework, 20 points
+ Quizzes, 1 point per question
+ Final project, 100 points

Quizzes are graded automatically by Canvas. Grades for discussion boards, homework, and your final project will be completed within 7 days of the due date.
