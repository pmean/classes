## Grade Appeal Policy

Students are responsible for meeting the standards of academic performance established for each course in which they are enrolled. The establishment of the criteria for grades and the evaluation of student academic performance are the responsibilities of the instructor.

The University [grade appeal procedure](https://www.umkc.edu/provost/Policy-Library/documents/tzt_Grade%20Appeal%20Policy.pdf) is available only for the review of allegedly capricious grading and not for review of the instructor's evaluation of the student's academic performance. Capricious grading, as that term is used here, comprises any of the following:

* The assignment of a grade to a particular student on some basis other than the performance in the course;

* The assignment of a grade to a particular student according to more exacting or demanding standards than were applied to other students in the course; (Note: Additional or different grading criteria may be applied to graduate students enrolled for graduate credit in 300- and 400-level courses.)

* The assignment of a grade by a substantial departure from the instructor's previously announced standards.

Students who have concerns about this course should first consult with the specific instructor with whom there is a problem. If the issues are not satisfactorily resolved the student should contact the course director.
