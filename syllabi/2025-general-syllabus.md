## Attendance Verification

Maintaining accurate enrollment records throughout the term is a partnership between instructors and students. Instructors are responsible for verifying student attendance and participation within the first three weeks (16 week course) through the Attendance Verification Survey (administered through UMKC Connect) as well as maintain records of participation throughout the term so that the last date of attendance for students with recorded “F” or “W” final grades may be submitted. Because student plans for enrollment sometimes change prior to the semester start, students not engaging in courses through the initial weeks of each course may be administratively dropped.

Visit the catalog for more detailed information regarding the policy.

## Recording Class Sessions

Students are not permitted to record class sessions without written consent from the course instructor. Contact your instructor to request permission.Instructor(s) may record class sessions for the sole purpose of sharing the recording with students who can’t attend class. Instructor(s) will take care not to disclose personally identifiable information from the student education records during the recorded lesson.

## Academic Integrity	

The Board of Curators of the University of Missouri recognizes that academic honesty is essential for the intellectual life of the University. Faculty members have a special obligation to expect high standards of academic honesty in all student work. Students have a special obligation to adhere to such standards. Academic dishonesty, including cheating, plagiarism, unauthorized use of artificially generated content or sabotage, is adjudicated through the University of Missouri Student Conduct Code and Rules of Procedures in Student Conduct Matters (CRR 200.010).

## Academic Support and Mentoring	

The department of Academic Support and Mentoring (ASM) offers a wide range of services and programs to help students meet their academic goals.

## Attendance Policy	

Students are expected to attend and participate in classes as indicated by the course modality (Classroom based, Online, etc. available on Pathway). To get additional information, please visit the page describing course modalities on the UMKC Registrar's site.

In order to comply with federal regulations associated with eligibility rules for federal financial aid, students not attending/participating a course during the first three weeks of the term will be administratively dropped from the specific course. Advance notice of attendance policies of academic units and individual instructors should be given, and such notice should be in writing. Students should notify instructors of excused absences in advance, where possible. Students who have an excused absence are expected to make arrangements with instructors for alternative or make-up work. Such arrangements should be made in advance of the absence, where possible. Instructors should accommodate excused absences to the extent that an accommodation can be made that does not unreasonably interfere with the learning objectives of the course or unduly burden the instructor. Attendance policies shall be applied in a non- discriminatory manner. Enrollment as a student is required to attend any class unless otherwise pre-approved by the instructor. Instructors are responsible for verifying student attendance and participation within the first three weeks (16 week course) through the Attendance Verification Survey (administered through UMKC Connect) as well as maintain records of participation throughout the term so that the last date of attendance for students with recorded “F” or “W” final grades may be submitted.

## Campus Safety

Inclement weather, mass notification, and emergency response guide can be found on the UMKC Alert page.

## UMKC Connect

Important information is available to undergraduate students in UMKC Connect a central location for faculty, advisors, student services and students to communicate and collaborate on a strategic plan for each student's academic success. Throughout the term, students may receive emails regarding course grades or academic performance. Students should regularly check their Connect dashboard and are expected to address information posted in a timely manner. This information may be shared with the student’s Success Network made up of his or her academic advisor(s) and other campus resources so that UMKC may fully support the student’s success.

Students may schedule appointments to meet with members of their Success Network through UMKC Connect.

## Grade Appeal Policy

The University grade appeal procedure is available only for the review of allegedly capricious grading and not for review of the instructor's evaluation of the student's academic performance. Capricious grading, as that term is used here, comprises any of the following:

-   The assignment of a grade to a particular student on some basis other than the performance in the course;
-   The assignment of a grade to a particular student according to more exacting or demanding standards than were applied to other students in the course; (Note: Additional or different grading criteria may be applied to graduate students enrolled for graduate credit in 300- and 400-level courses.)
-   The assignment of a grade by a substantial departure from the instructor's previously announced standards.

## Equal Opportunity & Educational Access	

UMKC is committed to providing equal opportunities to all students without unlawful discrimination on the basis of a protected identity, including race, color, national origin, ancestry, religion, sex, pregnancy, sexual orientation, gender identity, gender expression, age, disability, protected veteran status, or any other status protected by applicable state or federal law.

Discrimination & Harassment: Compliance with UM System Collected Rules and Regulations (CRRs) 600.000 is monitored by the Office of Equity & Title IX , but it is the responsibility of the entire university community to provide equal opportunity through relevant practices, initiatives, and programs. If you or someone you know has experienced discrimination or harassment based on their protected identity, we encourage you to visit Making a Report.

CRR 600.010 prohibits protected identity discrimination and harassment. It also prohibits sexual harassment and sexual misconduct by a student, employee, volunteer, or visitor that is not covered under CRR 600.020 and Title IX (see below), that occurs within a UMKC educational program or activity, on- or off-campus, including when the conduct occurs off-campus and interferes with or limits the ability of any person to participate in or benefit from UMKC’s educational programs or activities or employment. For those who have experienced discrimination or harassment, please see the Support and Connections pages of our Equity & Title IX website for a list of campus and community support services.

Sexual Harassment under Title IX: UM System Collected Rules and Regulations (CRRs)
600.020 prohibits all students, employees, volunteers, and visitors from engaging in sexual harassment, including sexual assault, dating violence, domestic violence, and stalking, in a university education program or activity against a person in the United States. If you or someone you know has experienced sexual harrassment, please visit the Support and Connection pages of our Equity & Title IX website for a list of support services on campus and in the community. For information on how to make a report to the university, visit Making a Report.

Failure to Accommodate Students with Disabilities: UM System Collected Rules and Regulations  (CRRs) 600.010 prohibits discrimination against students with disabilities and ensures these students receive educational accommodations as issued by Student Disability Services. If you believe an employee of the university has failed to accommodate your disability, visit Making a Report or contact the Office of Equity and Title IX at (816) 235-1771 or eqtix@umkc.edu.
 
Accommodating Pregnancy & Related Conditions: UMKC provides reasonable accommodations to students related to pregnancy and childbirth, including adjustments to attendance requirements, course due dates, leaves of absence, and other accommodations. If you have questions or would like to request arrangements, please visit Pregnancy & Related Accommodations or contact the Office of Equity & Title IX at (816) 235-1771 or eqtix@umkc.edu.

Mandated Reporting: Nearly all UMKC employees, including your course instructors, advisors, and other support staff, are required to report all information related to any known or suspected discrimination, harassment, or sexual misconduct to the Office of Equity & Title IX and cannot offer confidentiality. However, students may seek confidential support from RISE: Resources, Intervention, Support, & Education, Counseling Services, and Student Health & Wellness.

Employees of these offices are exempt from mandated reporting so long as the disclosure of prohibited conduct occurs in a confidential communication while they are acting as support advocates, professional counselors, or medical personnel. An exemption does not extend to these employees when the disclosure is made in non-confidential setting. If you have a question about confidentiality when making a disclosure to RISE, Counseling Services, or Student Health & Wellness, you should first ask whether the exemption applies.

## Right to Free Expression	

It is vitally important for UMKC to foster and maintain an educational environment that promotes free discussion, inquiry and expression by students inside the classroom and beyond, without fear that their exercise of such rights will have negative repercussions in areas over which the university has responsibility. It is equally important that students understand the narrow line separating their First Amendment rights and the legal and privacy rights of others so that students can exercise those rights within appropriate boundaries.

Per UM System Collected Rules and Regulations (CRRs) 200.015 your instructors should encourage free discussion, inquiry, and expression in courses, conferences and meetings. Student performance shall be evaluated solely on an academic basis, not on opinions or conduct in matters unrelated to academic standards.

Classroom Expectations: In exercising your right to free expression, UMKC requests students adhere to these five guidelines:

-   Share responsibility for including all voices in the conversation, leaving sufficient time for others to engage in the discussion. Listen respectfully, avoiding interruptions or distractions.
-   Recognize how your own identity and experiences inform your opinions and reactions to others. Be open to changing your perspectives when exposed to the ideas of others.
-   Speak with care, acknowledging that your words may be perceived as disrespectful, marginalizing, biased, or harmful.
-   Understand that everyone makes mistakes; view these mistakes as valuable in the learning process. Notice your own defensive reactions, and channel them into furthering a productive discussion.
-   Differentiate between safety and comfort; accept discomfort as necessary for learning and exploring ideas through a social justice lens.

Although your right to free expression is protected, your instructors have the authority to take action under CRR 200.010 when they believe the conduct of any student unreasonably disrupts the classroom environment and prevents others from learning or threatens or endangers the health or safety of any person. If you feel your instructor was in error in taking action under CRR 200.010 related to your right to free expression, visit Making a Report.

## Expressions of Perceived Bias	

UMKC is committed to equity, diversity, inclusion and respectful interaction. In support of our campus community, the university provides the opportunity for students, employees, volunteers, and visitors to report expressions of perceived bias and to request UMKC respond to such expressions.

An expression of perceived bias may occur when someone believes that they have been subjected to harassment, bullying, stereotyping, microaggressions, abuse, marginalization, or any other form of targeted misconduct because they identify or are associated with a particular group. If you believe you have experienced an expression of bias or you become aware of such an expression, visit Making a Report.

Support: If the conduct of others prevents you from fully participating in the classroom or in university activities, UMKC offers confidential support through Counseling Services and RISE: Resources, Intervention, Support, & Education. Additional campus and community support services are listed on the Support and Connections pages of our Equity & Title IX website.

Longitudinal data is data measured at several different time points. There are two common formats for longitudinal data. The short and fat format has one line per subject and the measurements at multiple time points stretch out to the right. The tall and thin format has multiple lines per subject, each line representing measurements at a different visit. Certain graphs and analyses are done more easily in the short and fat format, but others are done more easily in the tall and thin format. In this module, you will several examples of data sets in both formats and see how to convert from one format to another.

There are no assignments in this module. Please start work on your final project.
