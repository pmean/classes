### Statement on Expectations Regarding Student Conduct

In order to maintain a proper learning environment within the class, it is important for all students enrolled in this course to treat both the faculty and their peers with courtesy, civility and respect. Conduct for which students are subject to sanctions includes academic dishonesty, such as cheating, plagiarism, or sabotage. 

Students whose behavior is deemed disruptive by their instructor may be told to leave the classroom for the remainder of the session. Zero participation points will be earned for any weekly discussion activities when a student is told to leave the discussion.
