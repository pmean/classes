### Weekly assignments

The course will require students to complete assignments that are designed to contribute to the identification of a research topic and completion of the final course project - an original research proposal. The requirements for each assignment will be explained in detail. All assignments will be due by midnight of the following Wednesday. Full credit can only be earned on assignments that are turned in by the due date/time; assignments can be turned in after this date for partial credit. All assignments that are turned in will be reviewed by Dr. Simon and the student will receive feedback on the assignment. All assignments, unless otherwise noted, must be electronically submitted through the course Canvas site. All files submitted for grading MUST include the student's name in the file name. The assignments will be graded and will routinely be returned to students by the next class session.
