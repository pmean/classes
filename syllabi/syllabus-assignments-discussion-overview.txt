### Canvas Discussions

During the semester, you will be expected to participate in online discussions through the course Canvas site. Online discussion forums will provided the basis for discussions and activities that normally take place during an on-campus class period. Your engagement in the discussions will be reflected in the points you earn for participation. The minimum expectation is that you will respond to the topic, using the information you have read and/or the material presented in the recordings. Full participation in the discussion topics will be demonstrated by responses you make to the entries made by other students as well as the content of your own posting, and making these contributions in a timely manner (first posting must be made by Sunday midnight following the posting of the forums. A vital discussion board should include responses between students that expand on the original posting. Think of this as the interchange that occurs when we are all in the same room.

When a discussion topic is posted, please add your contribution by replying to the original topic. When you are responding to another student's posting, use the reply function.

I will regularly assign a student to be the participation leader in a specific discussion forum. The leader is expected to respond to each posting, adding to the discussion as appropriate and findings links between individual postings in a way that adds value to the overall discussion. The quality of what you do when you are the participation leader will be factored into the participation part of the course evaluation.
