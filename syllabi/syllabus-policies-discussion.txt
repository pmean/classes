### Discussion Board Guidelines - General Information

The purpose of the discussion board forum is to engage students in applying the concepts of this course in an exchange of ideas and opinions that is open, honest, and that stimulates transference of ideas to your own area of expertise and interest. Discussion board conversations also serve to build a sense of community among students in the class for the purpose of examining how the concepts we are studying are relevant to our own experiences. In the best tradition of the value of learning from each other, the following guidelines should guide us all as we participate in these discussions:

Participants should "listen" to others respectfully. Remember that when communicating via the computer screen, you do not have the benefit of voice intonation, facial expressions, body language or gestures to interpret the meaning behind the words. The same words spoken orally in different manners can mean different things. Remember this and give the person the benefit of the doubt when interpreting discussion board posts. Take your responsibilities seriously and offer meaningful feedback. Disagreements should focus on ideas and concepts, not the individual posting to the discussion board. If you disagree with what another student has written, strive to critique ideas in a respectful and constructive manner. When a disagreement occurs, attempt to understand other personâ€™s perspectives rather than to simply criticize them. Treat other students with the same respect and courtesy that promotes the same thoughtful and fair treatment that is supportive of face to face discussions.

Intervene politely if someone is being disrespectful or unfair to others. If you find something on the Discussion Board that strikes you as unacceptable in either tone or content, gently share your concern with the poster AND be sure to let the course instructor know about it as soon as possible Usually this kind of thing is the result of some kind of accident or misunderstanding, and I will make sure that it gets cleared up as soon as possible.

Keep the content of posts relevant to the topic. While the tone of your posts may be informal and genial, the discussion board is not a chat room. If necessary for personal messages, please use Mail or other forms of direct contact.

Use language, spelling and grammar that are appropriate to an educational setting. Avoid use of overly technical or discipline specific language, slang or Internet shorthand, and remember to proofread work prior to posting it for the class to read. Strive for proper spelling and grammar. Use complete sentences. Do not "shout" (i.e., type in capital letters).

Read and Reply. Note that your replies to others are just as important as the expression of your own initial thoughts about the topic. Take time to read what others have written and to give them relevant feedback when appropriate. Even if you have completed the requirements for posting in a given week, go back and see what others have written since you were last there.

Please be sure to bring any problems or suggestions regarding effective and courteous use of the discussion board to the attention of the course director.
