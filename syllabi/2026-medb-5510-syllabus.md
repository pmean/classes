## Introduction

Clinical research has been critical for the development of new medications and treatments. Successful research requires careful planning. You need to carefully choose between prospective and retrospective designs. You need to consider the ethical and practical implications associated with randomization. You need to establish reliability and validity for your measures. You need a plan for storing your data. This class will prepare you for all of the planning needs for a clinical research study. 

## Prerequisites

Only Graduate level students (students holding a BS or BA or higher degree) are permitted to register for this course.

## Course Objectives

This class will provide a firm foundation for your research career by showing the variety of research approaches that you can choose from, listing the advantages and disadvantages of each.

## Student Learning Objectives

At the end of this course, students will be able to:

-   create a well formulated research hypothesis
-   identify the best research design for this hypothesis
-   document all aspects of your research plan

## Course Framework

The general framework will be mostly consistent from week to week, but I reserve the right to make minor changes in this framework.

Each week, you will listen to weekly lectures, either via Zoom or through asynchronous videos. After listening to the lectures, you will

-   take a short quiz,
-   offer feedback on the lessons learned

There will be several writing assignments, culminating in a final project that prepares a literature review and methods section for a hypothetical study of your choice.

## Course Expectations, Course Policies, Requirements and Standards for Student Coursework and Student Behavior

As a general rule, you cannot ask another human (a fellow student, a friend, or a co-worker) to do your work for you, but you can ask for their assistance once you have a completed draft of your work. You can use generative AI, chatbots, and similar resources but only for limited parts of your work, not the entire assignment. See the [acceptable sources of assistance page][assistance] for specific details.

[assistance]: https://github.com/pmean/classes/blob/master/general/src/acceptable-sources-of-assistance.md

## Evaluation and Grading

Students will be required to post messages on the Canvas discussion boards, take brief quizzes on Canvas, and submit homework assignments in PDF format on Canvas. Your work is due on the specified date. We need to keep the class on the same time schedule for a variety of reasons. If illness, family issues, work responsibilities, or other commitments prevent you from completing on time, please contact me before the due date. Late submission without prior notice will receive a one point deduction. If you find yourself repeatedly falling behind on quizzes and assignments, it would be good to set up a meeting to discuss this.

This course is grade Credit/No Credit (Pass/Fail). Students who complete at least 80% of the regular coursework and successfully complete the final project will receive credit for the course.

## Point values for all assignments

+ Discussion boards, 3 points
+ Homework, 20 points
+ Quizzes, 1 point per question
+ Midterm presentation, 20 points
+ Midterm report, 20 points
+ Final exam, 60 points

There may be minor changes to amount of points assigned to the final exam. There may be an additional report due at the end of the semester.

Quizzes are graded automatically by Canvas. Grades for discussion boards, homework, and your final project will be completed within 14 days of the due date.

## E-mail

You must use a UMKC e-mail account for correspondence in this class.  The instructor will not be responsible for the receipt of e-mails that are sent to locations other than those ending with “umkc.edu”.

## Canvas

All students are required to be registered with Canvas in order to have access to course-related material that is posted on that site. All Announcements will be posted on Canvas and the student will also receive that Announcement via their UMKC email.

## Academic Honesty

The Board of Curators of the University of Missouri recognizes that academic honesty is essential for the intellectual life of the University. Faculty members have a special obligation to expect high standards of academic honesty in all student work. Students have a special obligation to adhere to such standards. Academic dishonesty, including cheating, plagiarism or sabotage, is adjudicated through the University of Missouri Student Conduct Code and Rules of Procedures in Student Conduct Matters. 

Conduct for which students are subject to sanctions includes academic dishonesty, such as cheating, plagiarism, or sabotage. In the event misconduct is confirmed, the students will receive 0 points on the exam or assignment. If academic dishonesty is admitted or confirmed by evidence the faculty are required to report the incident to the Assistant Dean for Graduate Studies, who will meet with the faculty member and student to review the event and then determine whether it should be further referred to the Dean of the School of Graduate Studies.  

Students enrolled in this course assume an obligation to behave in a manner compatible with the University's function as an educational institution as described in the University Collected Rules and Regulations Chapter 200 Student Conduct, section 200.010 Standard of Conduct. Conduct for which students are subject to sanctions includes academic dishonesty, such as cheating, plagiarism, or sabotage. Conduct for which students are subject to sanctions are outlined as follows: 

The term cheating includes but is not limited to: (i) use of any unauthorized assistance in taking quizzes, tests, or examinations; (ii) dependence upon the aid of sources beyond those authorized by the instructor in writing papers, preparing reports, solving problems, or carrying out other assignments; (iii) acquisition or possession without permission of tests or other academic material belonging to a member of the University faculty or staff; or (iv) knowingly providing any unauthorized assistance to another student on quizzes, tests, or examinations. 

The term plagiarism includes, but is not limited to: (i) use by paraphrase or direct quotation of the published or unpublished work of another person without fully and properly crediting the author with footnotes, citations or bibliographical reference; (ii) unacknowledged use of materials prepared by another person or agency engaged in the selling of term papers or other academic materials; or (iii) unacknowledged use of original work/material that has been produced through collaboration with others without release in writing from collaborators. 

The term sabotage includes, but is not limited to, the unauthorized interference with, modification of, or destruction of the work or intellectual property of another member of the University community.

To ensure academic integrity and prevent plagiarism, UMKC has purchased the Internet-based Turn It In.  This site allows faculty and students to submit papers online to examine a paper’s originality. The site compares submitted papers with several proprietary algorithm databases to check for plagiarism. The course director reserves the right to have student assignments reviewed on Turnitin.com in this course.  Submissions will have all identifying student information (name, student ID number etc.) removed from the submission to ensure that student’s rights are protected.  

## Academic Inquiry, Course Discussion and Privacy

## Grade Appeal Policy

Students are responsible for meeting the standards of academic performance established for each course in which they are enrolled. The establishment of the criteria for grades and the evaluation of student academic performance are the responsibilities of the instructor. 

The University grade appeal procedure is available only for the review of allegedly capricious grading and not for review of the instructor's evaluation of the student's academic performance. Capricious grading, as that term is used here, comprises any of the following: 

-   The assignment of a grade to a particular student on some basis other than the performance in the course; 
-   The assignment of a grade to a particular student according to more exacting or demanding standards than were applied to other students in the course; (Note: Additional or different grading criteria may be applied to graduate students enrolled for graduate credit in 300- and 400-level courses.) 
-   The assignment of a grade by a substantial departure from the instructor's previously announced standards. 

Students who have concerns about this course should first consult with the specific instructor with whom there is a problem. If the issues are not satisfactorily resolved the student should contact the course director. In the event a student would like to appeal a course grade they must follow the [School of Medicine procedure for grade appeal for graduate courses][ref08].
