### Canvas

Lecture material for weekly sessions will be posted on the Canvas course site before each class session. This material is to be reviewed before the class session - it will provide the foundation for activities that are planned for the weekly sessions.

Additional materials will be made available in electronic format on the Canvas website. Announcements and schedule updates will also be posted on the website.

A PowerPoint file containing overhead material for each session will be posted on Canvas before the class. You are responsible for having the material in this file available to refer to - either by downloading the file to your computer or by printing it out in a format for note-taking. Students who are assigned to lead discussions are expected to include this material in their discussions.

In order to prepare the recording of the oral presentation of your research project, you will need to use a computer on which you can install Panopto - you will need administrator’s rights to install the program. You will also need to have a microphone connected to the computer you are using for the recording – either as an "inboard" mic (e.g., most laptops) or plugged into a microphone/USB jack (e.g., many/most desktop computers). You will receive detailed information regarding how to prepare your presentation recording and upload it to the Canvas course site.

Many materials on the Canvas website can be read and/or printed with a standard web browser. Other items require Adobe Acrobat Reader to view.
