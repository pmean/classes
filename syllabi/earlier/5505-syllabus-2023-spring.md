<!--3-->### General Policies for UMKC Courses

&nbsp;

<!--3a-->#### Will I be dropped from class if I not attend class?  What happens if I do not attend class without communicating with my instructor?

Maintaining accurate enrollment records throughout the term is a partnership between instructors and students.  Instructors are responsible for verifying student attendance and participation within the first three weeks (16 week course) through the Attendance Verification Survey (administered through UMKC Connect) as well as maintain records of participation throughout the term so that the last date of attendance for students with recorded "F" or "W" final grades may be submitted.  Because student plans for enrollment sometimes change prior to the semester start, students not engaging in courses through the initial weeks of each course may be administratively dropped.  For more detailed information refer to the [UMKC Administrative Drop Policy][u1]

[u1]: https://catalog.umkc.edu/undergraduate-academic-regulations-information/registration/administrative-drop-policy/

<!--3b-->#### How do I get permission before recording class sessions?

Instructor(s) may record class sessions for the sole purpose of sharing the recording with students who can't attend class. Instructor(s) will take care not to disclose personally identifiable information from the student education records during the recorded lesson. Students are not permitted to record class sessions without written consent from the course instructor.

<!--3c-->#### Is there Recommended Technology that I should have access to?

You will need access to the computing resources necessary to complete this course through personal and/or University channels (e.g., computer labs). Our course will take place within the Canvas LMS and utilizing various software technologies that facilitate interaction and communication. We can make alternate arrangements should your reason for being without computer access warrant an accommodation (note: travel for vacation/work does not necessitate accommodations).

<!--5-->### Specific Information about this class

&nbsp;

<!--5a-->#### Required and Recommended Materials

There is NO required textbook for this class.

<!--5b-->#### Course Expectations, Course Policies, Requirements and Standards for Student Coursework and Student Behavior

You are expected to do your homework independently. You can seek help from your instructors, from colleagues, or from the Internet to help decode an error message that you don't understand. You can adapt code that you find on the Internet. We recommend that you acknowledge the source for that code in the comments of your program, but this is not required.

<!--5c-->#### Evaluation and Grading

Students will be required to post messages on the Canvas discussion boards, take brief quizzes on Canvas, and submit homework assignments in PDF format on Canvas. Your work is due on the specified date. We need to keep the class on the same time schedule for a variety of reasons. If illness, family issues, work responsibilities, or other commitments prevent you from completing on time, please contact me before the due date. Late submission without prior notice will receive a one point deduction. If you find yourself repeatedly falling behind on quizzes and assignments, it would be good to set up a meeting to discuss this.

This course is grade Credit/No Credit (Pass/Fail). Students who complete at least 80% of the regular coursework and successfully complete the final project will receive credit for the course.

Point values for all assignments

+ Discussion boards, 3 points
+ Homework, 20 points
+ Quizzes, 1 point per question
+ Final project, 100 points

Quizzes are graded automatically by Canvas. Grades for discussion boards, homework, and your final project will be completed within 7 days of the due date.

<!--5d-->#### Final Exam

This is no final exam. Your final project needs to be completed prior to the last day of classes.

<!--6f-->#### Module05

In addition to reviewing methods appropriate for continuous variables and those appropriate for categorical variables, we will examine methods that help in exploring the relationship between a continuous and a categorical variable. This includes tables of means and standard deviations as well as boxplots.

There is a discussion board, homework assignment, and quiz.

Start this module in the tenth week of class (fifth week in summer session) and complete all the assignments by the end of the twelfth week of class (sixth week in summer session). The due dates for assignments may vary slightly from this time schedule.

<!--6g-->#### Module06

Longitudinal data is data measured at several different time points. There are two common formats for longitudinal data. The short and fat format has one line per subject and the measurements at multiple time points stretch out to the right. The tall and thin format has multiple lines per subject, each line representing measurements at a different visit. Certain graphs and analyses are done more easily in the short and fat format, but others are done more easily in the tall and thin format. In this module, you will several examples of data sets in both formats and see how to convert from one format to another.

There are no assignments in this module. Please start work on your final project.

Start this module in the twelfth fourth week of class (sixth week in summer session).

<!--6h-->#### Final project

Find a data set that interests you.

+ Read it into R and compute some summary statistics. Are there any missing values?
+ Create a factor for at least one categorical variable.
+ Draw at least one graph appropriate for your data.
+ Produce at least two other statistics or graphs that you think might be interesting and informative.
+ Provide a brief interpretation in the context of your data set for everything that you produce above.

You may already have a data set that interests you, but if you do not, there are many data sources on the web that you can use. Contact me if you need any help finding an appropriate data set.

Start your final project in the twelfth week of class (sixth week in summer session) and complete all the assignments by the end of the semester.
