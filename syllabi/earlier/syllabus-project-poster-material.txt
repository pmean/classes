### Final project - poster material

The presentation needs to include "poster material" so that you get practice preparing material required for poster presentations at professional meetings. The PowerPoint material you prepare for your oral presentation will probably serve as the basis for your poster material. It is not a requirement for this course that the poster material be printed/produced at the same high quality expected for a professional meeting. The purpose of preparing the poster material for this course is to give you experience preparing the content that is expected for a professional poster presentation; you should be able to do this without any additional expense for the preparation of the poster material.
