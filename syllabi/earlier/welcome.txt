For the purpose of this online asynchronous course, I have structured due dates around Thursday as the class session day. You will be given specific information on all due dates, but know that these have been timed as if you were attending the course session on Thursday.

 

The required textbook for this class is:

Technology Requirements -

You are expected to have the computing resources necessary to complete this course through personal and/or University channels (e.g., computer labs). Generally, your work will be submitted through the course Blackboard site. Please contact me if you will be without internet or email access for a short-term basis during this course. We can make alternate arrangements should your reason for being without computer access warrants an accommodation (note: travel for vacation/work affects technology access).

 

In order to prepare the recording of the oral presentation of your research project, you will need to use a computer on which you can install Panopto – you will need administrator’s rights to install the program. You will also need to have a microphone connected to the computer you are using for the recording – either as an “inboard” mic (e.g., most laptops) or plugged into a microphone/USB jack (e.g., many/most desktop computers). You will receive detailed information regarding how to prepare your presentation recording and upload it to the Blackboard course site.
