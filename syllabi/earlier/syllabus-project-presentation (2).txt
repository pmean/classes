### Final Project Oral Presentation

You will prepare a recorded video presentation of your research proposal using a research conference style and upload into the course Canvas site. The oral presentation should be planned as a brief presentation (approximately 10 min). The presentation should be based on objectives, background, methods, and discussion of the possible contribution findings of this research project could have. The American Public Health Association has some basic guidelines for presenters on their website that can be used when making your PowerPoint slides and gauging presentation length. All students will complete a scorecard for the presentation of all other students in order to provide constructive comments to the presenters. All scorecards will be submitted to Dr. Simon via the course Canvas site and he will distribute anonymous comments to presenters upon request by the presenter.
