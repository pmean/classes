### Introduction

Clinical research has always been critical for the discovery of new knowledge and the development of new medications and treatments. Now, clinical research carries an increasingly important role as it contributes to critical issues facing our health care system. These issues include such things as the identification of social and individual factors that influence clinical outcomes, determination of optimal treatment regimens, and methods to optimize outcomes and efficiencies in clinical care. This clinical research methods course is designed to provide the foundation for people who plan to contribute to research that has the potential to have a significant impact on health care.
