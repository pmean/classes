### Class structure

In general, each class session will consist of a mixture of recorded material available on Canvas as preparation for the session, individual assignments, and discussion/activities that are related to the topic and are completed either individually, within pairs, or within small groups of students. The lecture material is designed to supplement the information assigned from the textbook and other sources.
