### Final Project - Overview

All MSB students will complete either a thesis of capstone project as part of their program completion and all PhD students will complete a doctoral dissertation. Completing a thesis is a requirement for students in the genomics emphasis area and an option for all other MSB students. Because of the value department faculty place on the student's ability to plan and propose a research project, the major project of this course will be a presentation (in both oral and written form) of a proposal for a research project on a specific topic that is of interest to you. The goal is for this research proposal to provide an experience that is relevant to the preparation of proposals such as a thesis or dissertation proposal or a proposal to obtain research funding.
