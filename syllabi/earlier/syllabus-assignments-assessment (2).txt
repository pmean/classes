### Assessment Item Development

For the weekly sessions, each student will submit through the course Canvas site a file that contains three items that could be used to assess the student's comprehension of the reading material and lecture presentation. To get full credit for this aspect of evaluation, students must submit the items by midnight on Tuesday night before the weekly class session. An assessment item can be in the form of multiple choice, true/false, short answer - any format that you think is appropriate to assess comprehension of the weekly material. You must indicate the correct response for each item that you submit. Items selected from all those submitted will be compiled and will be the basis of a discussion forum that will be posted on Thursday for each weekly session. Assessment item submissions that are received following the posting of the assessment item discussion forum will receive 0 points.
