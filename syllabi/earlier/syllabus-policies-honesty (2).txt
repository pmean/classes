### Academic honesty

The Board of Curators of the University of Missouri recognizes that academic honesty is essential for the intellectual life of the University. Faculty members have a special obligation to expect high standards of academic honesty in all student work. Students have a special obligation to adhere to such standards. Academic dishonesty, including cheating, plagiarism or sabotage, is adjudicated through the University of Missouri Student Conduct Code and Rules of Procedures in Student Conduct Matters.

Conduct for which students are subject to sanctions includes academic dishonesty, such as cheating, plagiarism, or sabotage. In the event misconduct is confirmed, the students will receive 0 points on the exam or assignment. If academic dishonesty is admitted or confirmed by evidence the faculty are required to report the incident to the Assistant Dean for Graduate Studies, who will meet with the faculty member and student to review the event and then determine whether it should be further referred to the Dean of the School of Graduate Studies.

Students enrolled in this course assume an obligation to behave in a manner compatible with the University's function as an educational institution as described in the University Collected Rules and Regulations Chapter 200 Student Conduct, section 200.010 Standard of Conduct. Conduct for which students are subject to sanctions includes academic dishonesty, such as cheating, plagiarism, or sabotage. Conduct for which students are subject to sanctions are outlined as follows:

The term cheating includes but is not limited to: (i) use of any unauthorized assistance in taking quizzes, tests, or examinations; (ii) dependence upon the aid of sources beyond those authorized by the instructor in writing papers, preparing reports, solving problems, or carrying out other assignments; (iii) acquisition or possession without permission of tests or other academic material belonging to a member of the University faculty or staff; or (iv) knowingly providing any unauthorized assistance to another student on quizzes, tests, or examinations.

The term plagiarism includes, but is not limited to: (i) use by paraphrase or direct quotation of the published or unpublished work of another person without fully and properly crediting the author with footnotes, citations or bibliographical reference; (ii) unacknowledged use of materials prepared by another person or agency engaged in the selling of term papers or other academic materials; or (iii) unacknowledged use of original work/material that has been produced through collaboration with others without release in writing from collaborators. In addition, the Department of Biomedical and Health Informatics includes self-plagiarism in their expanded definition. 

Self-plagiarism is reuse of an existing paper that has been submitted for credit in a different course without prior discussion and consent of the course director.

The term sabotage includes, but is not limited to, the unauthorized interference with, modification of, or destruction of the work or intellectual property of another member of the University community.

To ensure academic integrity and prevent plagiarism, UMKC has purchased the Internet-based Turn It In. This site allows faculty and students to submit papers online to examine a paper’s originality. The site compares submitted papers with several proprietary algorithm databases to check for plagiarism. The course director reserves the right to have student assignments reviewed on Turnitin.com in this course. Submissions will have all identifying student information (name, student ID number etc.) removed from the submission to ensure that student’s rights are protected.

Academic Inquiry, Course Discussion and Privacy: University of Missouri System Executive Order No. 38 lays out principles regarding the sanctity of classroom discussions at the university. The policy is described fully in Section 200.015 of the Collected Rules and Regulations. In this class, students may make audio or video recordings of course activity unless specifically prohibited by the faculty member. However, the redistribution of any audio or video recordings of statements or comments from the course to individuals who are not students in the course is prohibited without the express permission of the faculty member and of any students who are recorded, including those recordings prepared by an instructor. Students found to have violated this policy are subject to discipline in accordance with provisions of Section 200.020 of the Collected Rules and Regulations of the University of Missouri pertaining to student conduct matters.
