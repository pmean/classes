### Submission format

Unless otherwise noted, all material that is submitted to Dr. Simon must be submitted via the course Canvas site and should be .pdf format. If you have difficulty producing pdf format files, alternate formats may be acceptable, but please clear this in advance. All files sent to Dr. Simon must include the student's name in the filename.
