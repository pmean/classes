## Introduction

Clinical research has been critical for the development of new medications and treatments. Now, clinical research carries an increasingly important role as it contributes to critical issues facing our health care system. In order for clinical research to address these issues, appropriate methods for data processing and analysis must be conducted. The Department of Biomedical and Health Informatics Biostatistics sequence has been designed to provide students with the applied knowledge and skills they will need in order to contribute to the creation, analysis, and understanding of data generated by clinical and patient care studies. 

## Prerequisites

Only Graduate level students (students holding a BS or BA or higher degree) are permitted to register for this course and Prior Statistics coursework with a passing grade of B or higher and a grade of 80% or better on a placement exam administered by the course director for MEDB5502 or completion of MEDB 5501 with a passing grade of B- or higher.

This course is the second course in the Biostatistics sequence and is intended for students, physicians, and researchers in the biological, clinical and medical fields, and medical education. This course introduces statistical concepts, analysis methods, and research designs for applied data commonly encountered in the biological, clinical and medical research. Topics include diagnostic testing, hypothesis testing, power analysis, analysis of variance, analysis of covariance, multivariate analysis of variance, propensity scoring, simple and multiple regression, logistic regression, survival analysis, and evidence based medicine. Familiarity with the basic statistics and statistical techniques presented in Biostatistics I is required. Statistical analyses involved in this course will be performed primarily using the SPSS statistical analysis package. The course will also cover the interpretation, presentation and the write up of analytical results and graphs.

## Course Objectives

The Biostatistics sequence (MEDB5501 and 5502) will provide students with an understanding of basic and more advanced concepts in statistics as applied to health sciences. The objective of this course, MEDB5502, is to equip students with knowledge of advanced biostatistics methods for designing studies and analyzing data from biomedical, clinical, and public health research studies. This course will provide students a foundation for evaluating outcomes of medical and clinical research as well as prepare them to be intelligent consumers of the health research literature. This course will also provide a firm foundation for more advanced and specialized statistical analysis course work if pursued. 

## Student Learning Objectives

At the end of this course, students will be able to:
-   Understand and implement the statistical concepts behind diagnostic testing
-   Manage and analyze data sets in order to test research hypotheses
-   Estimate and summarize data characteristics in order to determine appropriate statistical analysis methods
-   Apply statistical methods for analyzing continuous data, specifically analysis of variance, analysis of covariance, multivariate analysis of variance, linear regression, and multiple regression
-   Apply statistical methods for analyzing categorical data, such as logistic regression, survival analysis, and other nonparametric statistical methods
-   Understanding the theory of propensity score generation as well as its application to research design
-   Understand the principles of Evidence Based Medicine
-   Apply the statistical knowledge gained in this course in a practical manner
-   Undertake further study of statistics if desired

## Course Framework

There is a long tradition of data management and statistical analysis as applied to research on various health topics from multicenter drug development trials to clinical outcomes studies to small sample clinical research.  Understanding the statistical analysis methods required to conduct valid research is critical as clinical research plays an increasingly significant role in the evolution of our health care system. Results from clinical research studies contribute not only to the development of new drugs, devices and treatments but also to the determination of the best treatments for health care providers to offer patients (best practice).  The readings, assignments, quizzes, semester project, and midterm and final exams in this course are designed to be relevant to the application of the knowledge and skills gained in MEDB5502 to clinical, biomedical, and public health research.   

## Course Expectations, Course Policies, Requirements and Standards for Student Coursework and Student Behavior

You are expected to do your homework independently. You can seek help from your instructors, from colleagues, or from the Internet to help decode an error message that you don't understand. You can adapt code that you find on the Internet. We recommend that you acknowledge the source for that code in the comments of your program, but this is not required.

## Evaluation and Grading

Students will be required to post messages on the Canvas discussion boards, take brief quizzes on Canvas, and submit homework assignments in PDF format on Canvas. Your work is due on the specified date. We need to keep the class on the same time schedule for a variety of reasons. If illness, family issues, work responsibilities, or other commitments prevent you from completing on time, please contact me before the due date. Late submission without prior notice will receive a one point deduction. If you find yourself repeatedly falling behind on quizzes and assignments, it would be good to set up a meeting to discuss this.

This course is grade Credit/No Credit (Pass/Fail). Students who complete at least 80% of the regular coursework and successfully complete the final project will receive credit for the course.

## Point values for all assignments

+ Discussion boards, 3 points
+ Homework, 20 points
+ Quizzes, 1 point per question
+ Midterm presentation, 20 points
+ Midterm report, 20 points
+ Final exam, 60 points

There may be minor changes to amount of points assigned to the final exam. There may be an additional report due at the end of the semester.

Quizzes are graded automatically by Canvas. Grades for discussion boards, homework, and your final project will be completed within 14 days of the due date.

## E-mail

You must use a UMKC e-mail account for correspondence in this class.  The instructor will not be responsible for the receipt of e-mails that are sent to locations other than those ending with “umkc.edu”.

## Academic Honesty

The Board of Curators of the University of Missouri recognizes that academic honesty is essential for the intellectual life of the University. Faculty members have a special obligation to expect high standards of academic honesty in all student work. Students have a special obligation to adhere to such standards. Academic dishonesty, including cheating, plagiarism or sabotage, is adjudicated through the University of Missouri Student Conduct Code and Rules of Procedures in Student Conduct Matters. 

Conduct for which students are subject to sanctions includes academic dishonesty, such as cheating, plagiarism, or sabotage. In the event misconduct is confirmed, the students will receive 0 points on the exam or assignment. If academic dishonesty is admitted or confirmed by evidence the faculty are required to report the incident to the Assistant Dean for Graduate Studies, who will meet with the faculty member and student to review the event and then determine whether it should be further referred to the Dean of the School of Graduate Studies.  

Students enrolled in this course assume an obligation to behave in a manner compatible with the University's function as an educational institution as described in the University Collected Rules and Regulations Chapter 200 Student Conduct, section 200.010 Standard of Conduct. Conduct for which students are subject to sanctions includes academic dishonesty, such as cheating, plagiarism, or sabotage. Conduct for which students are subject to sanctions are outlined as follows: 

The term cheating includes but is not limited to: (i) use of any unauthorized assistance in taking quizzes, tests, or examinations; (ii) dependence upon the aid of sources beyond those authorized by the instructor in writing papers, preparing reports, solving problems, or carrying out other assignments; (iii) acquisition or possession without permission of tests or other academic material belonging to a member of the University faculty or staff; or (iv) knowingly providing any unauthorized assistance to another student on quizzes, tests, or examinations. 

The term plagiarism includes, but is not limited to: (i) use by paraphrase or direct quotation of the published or unpublished work of another person without fully and properly crediting the author with footnotes, citations or bibliographical reference; (ii) unacknowledged use of materials prepared by another person or agency engaged in the selling of term papers or other academic materials; or (iii) unacknowledged use of original work/material that has been produced through collaboration with others without release in writing from collaborators. 

The term sabotage includes, but is not limited to, the unauthorized interference with, modification of, or destruction of the work or intellectual property of another member of the University community.

To ensure academic integrity and prevent plagiarism, UMKC has purchased the Internet-based Turn It In.  This site allows faculty and students to submit papers online to examine a paper’s originality. The site compares submitted papers with several proprietary algorithm databases to check for plagiarism. The course director reserves the right to have student assignments reviewed on Turnitin.com in this course.  Submissions will have all identifying student information (name, student ID number etc.) removed from the submission to ensure that student’s rights are protected.

## Grade Appeal Policy

Students are responsible for meeting the standards of academic performance established for each course in which they are enrolled. The establishment of the criteria for grades and the evaluation of student academic performance are the responsibilities of the instructor. 

The University grade appeal procedure is available only for the review of allegedly capricious grading and not for review of the instructor's evaluation of the student's academic performance. Capricious grading, as that term is used here, comprises any of the following: 

-   The assignment of a grade to a particular student on some basis other than the performance in the course; 
-   The assignment of a grade to a particular student according to more exacting or demanding standards than were applied to other students in the course; (Note: Additional or different grading criteria may be applied to graduate students enrolled for graduate credit in 300- and 400-level courses.) 
-   The assignment of a grade by a substantial departure from the instructor's previously announced standards. 

Students who have concerns about this course should first consult with the specific instructor with whom there is a problem. If the issues are not satisfactorily resolved the student should contact the course director. In the event a student would like to appeal a course grade they must follow the [School of Medicine procedure for grade appeal for graduate courses][ref08].
