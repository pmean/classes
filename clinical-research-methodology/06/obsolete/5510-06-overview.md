#### Observational studies

#### Synopsis

Observational studies are  used when the researcher does not control the intervention. The intervention is under the control of the patients and their health care providers.  Or the intervention is not under the control of anyone. In this case, the intervention is often called an exposure instead. There are strong advantages and disadvantages to the use of observational research. While it often takes more effort to manage and analyze observational data, it can still provide definitive conclusions.

Secondary data analysis, retrospective evaluation of data collected for other purposes, is a commonly encountered form of observational research. There are many sources of secondary data that allow you to quickly and inexpensively produce good research.

#### Learning objectives

In this module, you will learn how to

+ distinguish different types of quantitative non-experimental approaches
+ discuss strengths and weaknesses of qualitative research

#### Readings and Resources

Handouts associated with the videos are draft only at this point. They will be finalized on or before noon on 2022-02-23 (Wednesday).

+ Required reading
  + Chapter 7 of Gliner, Morgan, and Leech.

+ Recommended reading
  + See the [recommended reading page][git2] on my github site.

+ Handouts associated with videos
  + Video06. Observational research. Slides and speaker notes available in [pdf format][git1]

#### Videos

I plan to review the videos from last year and either re-use them or re-record them. You will get live links to these videos on or before 5pm on 2022-02-25 (Friday).

There are 8 videos with a total of about 105 minutes.

+ Videos to be recorded

  + V06-01, Secondary data analysis (about 29 minutes)
  + V06-02, Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (about 17 minutes)
  + V06-03, Bureau of the Census (about 16 minutes)
  + V06-04, Cohort designs (about 17 minutes)
  + V06-05, Case-control designs (about 10 minutes)
  + V06-06, Cross-sectional designs (about 7 minutes)
  + V06-07, Historical control designs (4 minutes)
  + V06-08, Your homework (about 5 minutes).

For archival purposes, I am including a [page with links to video recordings][git0] done back in 2019, 2020, and 2021. You do not need to watch these, and you probably do not want to watch them. I am putting them here because I want to eventually turn the content of these videos into a book about research methods.

#### Active Learning

Links to the homework assignments will be finalized on or before noon on 2022-02-23 (Wednesday).

There is

+ a discussion board,
+ a short quiz, and
+ a homework assignment

available on the Canvas website.
