## Drawing a fishbone diagram, 1 of 3

![First step in drawing a fisbone diagram](images/draw-fishbone-01.png)

::: notes
There are two tools in QI that are very helpful during the planning process, the fishbone diagram and the Pareto chart.

The fishbone diagram (also called the Ishikawa diagram, or the case and effect diagram) is a tool for identifying the root causes of quality problems. It was named after Kaoru Ishikawa, the man who pioneered the use of this chart in quality improvement in the 1960's. It is a graphical method for displaying possible causes of a quality problem.

If you want to use a Fishbone Diagram, first list the main problem on the right hand side of the paper. Then draw a horizontal line to represent the "backbone" of the diagram. This line is not labeled.

::: notes

Off of the backbone, draw and label major bones: 4 to 7 major categories of causes. A commonly used list of major causes is Management, Manpower, Machines, and Materials.

Another possible list is Policies, Procedures, Plant, and People.

::: notes
Then attach specific causes to the appropriate category.

Some people allow the individual causes to have subcauses, which would be attached to the minor bones. This is intended to get at the fundamental or root causes of the problem. Other people do not include this level of detail on their fishbone diagrams.

The process of developing a fishbone diagram can be done by an individual, but more commonly it is done by a team. You can use standard brainstorming approaches for the fishbone diagram. For example you could go around the table repeatedly asking each person to list a cause. Only after all the possible causes are listed do you review and possibly winnow down the list. Then arrange the remaining causes on the fishbone.

If you do use a team to develop a fishbone diagram, make sure that all relevant parties are included. No fair getting input only from doctors and ignoring nurses, for example, in a health care setting. The rule should be that at least one person from any group that is associated with the work process should be included.

When you are done, look at the entire diagram. Does it have reasonable balance across the major bones? Are any common themes emerging? Can you identify causes that are measurable and fixable and which you believe are likely to have a large impact on the problem?

In some situations, you may find that a flow diagram of the work process may be more valuable and informative.

## Fishbone example, 1 of 4

![Fishbone diagram](images/fishbone-example-01.png)

::: notes
As you will see, there is no standard format or structure for a Fishbone diagram.

Here is an example of a Fishbone diagram in a published research study. The problem, shown only in the legend, is side discrepancies in radiologic reports. The major bones are Environment, Radiologist, Imaging Exams, and Voice Recognition. Two specific causes on the environment bone are background noise and crowd.

::: notes
Here's a second example. The problem is non-retention of HIV-positive adolescents in care. The major bones are Health Services factors, Adolescent factors, and Accessibility factors. Two of the specific causes on the adolescent factor bone are stigma, and lack of empowerment.

::: notes
Here's a third example.  The problem is the small number of cases referred to the PSU. The major bones are equipment, patients, procedures, and environments. Two specific causes on the patients bone are lack of awareness and stigma.

## Fishbone example, 4 of 4

![Fishbone diagram](images/fishbone-example-04.png)

::: notes
Here's one last example. The problem is non-adherence. The major bones are patient factors, tech factors, physician factors, communication, environment/organization, and materials/resources. Two of the specific causes on the physician factor are fear of litigation and knowledge of guidelines (I presume they mean lack of knowledge of guidelines).
