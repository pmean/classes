## Categorical values

-   Definition: small number of possible values
-   Beware of ambiguities
    -   YES, yes, and Yes are three distinct levels.
-   Use number codes
    -   0, 1, 9 for binary variables
-   Single letter codes
    -   M, F, and U for gender
    -   Potentially ambiguous
    -   Consistent case is important.

::: notes

A categorical variable is a variable with a small number of possible values. What's small? If you can state all the possible values without taking a breath, that's categorical. Actually, don't worry excessively about what meets the definition of categorical. Use a bit of common sense and you'll be fine.

Some people use text strings to designate categorical variables. This requires more typing, which may not be too serious a concern, but it also raises the possibility of ambiguity, especially if several people are responsible for data entry.

Note that the strings YES (all upper case), yes (all lower case), and Yes (Mixed case) may look the same to you, but they are treated as separate categories by the computer. 

Your book recommends number codes, and I agree with them. But you should know that others hate number codes and prefer the use of short strings or single letter codes.

Single letter codes are easy to remember. The letter codes (M, F, and U) for gender are obviously Male, Female, and Unknown. These single letters are also convenient plotting codes. At times, the codes can be ambiguous. Did you code your patients W for white, or C for Caucasian?

## Example of ambiguous coding

![](images/ambiguous-frequency-table-01.png "Frequency table showing ambiguous results: blanks and two W values")

::: notes

Here is an example of ambiguous data that I documented on my website back in 2007. I had a data set with a variable RaceID, and when I examined the data using the frequencies procedure in SPSS, I got this table. It shows two observations with blank values at the very top. This is bad form, as I noted earlier, and a special code letter like U or X should be presented instead. Notice also that W appears twice. The first W has a slight indent to it, which gives you a hint that something is not quite right. It turns out that there was a patient with a race code that was two characters long rather than one character. And those two characters were blank and W.

That was easy enough to fix, but this is why they pay me the big bucks. Because I pay very close attention to small details that might otherwise screw up the analysis.

One more nitpick. The code for A is ambiguous. Does it mean Asian American or American Indian? I can guess most of the others: B for Black, C for Causasian, H for Hispanic, O for Other and W for White (Why was this not combined with C?).

## Reverse coding (1 of 2)

-   Context specific
-   Sequence of IF THEN ELSE statements

```{}
if (is.na(x)) then y=NA
  else if (x=1) then y=4
  else if (x=2) then y=3
  else if (x=3) then y=2
  else if (x=4) then y=1
  else y=9
```
::: notes

Reverse scaling is tedious and always go slowly, because tedium tends to produce simple mistakes. SPSS has a very nice recode dialog box that is hard to mess up. 

You can also use a series of IF THEN ELSE commands to do the reverse coding. Always start by recoding the missing value. Notice that I took the time to code as 9 anything outside what I believed were the only possible values.

## Reverse coding (2 of 2)

-   Functional transformations

```{}
0,1 to 1,0

 x    y=1-x

 0      1
 1      0
 
 1,2,3,4 to 4,3,2,1   but  0,1,2,3,4 to 4,3,2,1,0
 
  x          y=5-x          x            y=4-x
  1            4            0              4
  2            3            1              3
  3            2            2              2
  4            1            3              1
                            4              0

```

-   Always check your results
-   Watch out for missing value codes

::: notes

But if you want to be clever, there is usually a simple mathematical function of the form k-x  or k+1-x that will reverse scale everything all at once.

If you had a variable with values 0 and 1, the function f(x)=1-x will effectively convert the 0 to a 1 and the 1 to a 0.

If you had a variable with values 1, 2, 3, and 4, the function f(x)=5-x would effectively reverse these values. But note that if 0 were legal, if the possible values were 0, 1, 2, 3, and 4, then the proper function would be f(x)=4-x.

Always account properly for missing values when reverse scaling. It's a good idea to do a simple frequency table before and after reverse coding. It is also a good idea to store the reverse coded variable under a different name, so that you could easily undo any mistakes that you might have made.

## A multiple response example

![](images/multiple-response-01.png "Hypothetical responses to What are a few of your favorite things with multiple responses allowed")

::: notes

This is an example of a questionnaire where the patients can choose one of more of the following favorite things: Raindrops on roses, or whiskers on kittens. Bright copper kettles, or warm woolen mittens.

The first patient liked the last three things: whiskers on kittens, bright copper kettles, and warm woolen mittens.

The second patient liked the first three things: raindrops on roses, whiskers on kittens, and bright copper kettles.

The third patient liked the last two things: bright copper kettles, and warm woolen mittens.

## Coding with a single string

![](images/multiple-response-02.png "Coding of multiple responses using a single string: bcd, abc or cd")

::: notes

You can code all the possible responses in a single column. Since the first person chose the last three responses, code their response as bcd. The second person chose the first three responses, and would be coded as abc. The third person only chose the last two responses, and would be coded cd.

This approach makes it difficult to compute even simple statistics, such as the proportion of patients who chose "Whiskers on kittens." You'd have to work with a string search function. How many of the strings contain the letter b? It's not a terribly hard amount of work, but with a bit of planning, you could make it a bit easier for yourself down the road. 

:::

## Coding using single letters

![](images/multiple-response-03.png "Coding of multiple responses using single letters, a, b, c, or d, in individual columns")

::: notes

You could split this into three columns, putting the first selection in the first column, the second selection in the second column, and the third selection in the third column. So the bcd gets split into b in the first column, c in the second column, and d in the third column. The abc gets split into a in the first column, b in the second column, and c in the third column. The cd gets split into c in the first column, d in the second column and the third column is left blank.

This is a bit better, but there are still some problems. 

This format produces some unneeded missing values, such as for the patient who has less than three favorite things.

If you find out halfway through the survey that someone chose all four favorite things, you'd have to go back and add a new column. 

This format is also a bit tricky. Notice how even though all three patients selected c, the letter appears once in the third column, once in the second column, and once in the first column. If you wanted the percentage of patients who chose "c," you'd have to calculate the percentage of c's in the first column, and add it to the percentage of c's in the second column and the percentage of c's in the third column.

## Coding using indicator variables

![](images/multiple-response-04.png "Coding of multiple responses using indicator (0, 1) variables for each possible response")

::: notes

The recommended way to code multiple response is to create indicator variables for each possible response. The q1.a column is one for the second patient, as he/she was the only one who who liked raindrops on roses. The other two patients get a zero in this column. The q1.b column is one for the first and second patients, who both liked whiskers on kittens, but zero for the third patient who did not like whiskers on kittens. What's wrong here? Who doesn't like whiskers on kittens? The q1.c column is one for everybody because everybody liked bright copper kettles. Finally, in column q1.d, the first and third patients get ones for the like of warm woolen mittens, and the second patient gets a zero.

So the number of patients who like whiskers on kittens is just the number of ones in column q1.b.

Also note another big advantage here--no blank cells!
