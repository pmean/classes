Abstract: P-values and confidence intervals are the fundamental tools used in most inferential data analyses. They are possibly the most commonly reported statistics in the medical literature. Unfortunately, both p-values and confidence intervals are subject to frequent misinterpretations. In this two hour webinar, you will learn the proper interpretation of p-values and confidence intervals, and the common abuses and misconceptions about these statistics. You will also see a simple application of Bayesian analysis which provides an alternative to p-values and confidence intervals.

In this seminar, you will learn how to:

distinguish between statistical significance and clinical significance;

define and interpret p-values;

explain the ethical issues associated with inadequate sample sizes.

explain the difference between informative and diffuse priors;

interpret statistics from a posterior distribution.

1. The Outcome of Extubation Failure in a Community Hospital Intensive Care Unit: A Cohort Study. Seymour CW, Martinez A, Christie JD, Fuchs BD. Critical Care 2004, 8:R322-R327 (20 July 2004) Introduction: Extubation failure has been associated with poor intensive care unit (ICU) and hospital outcomes in tertiary care medical centers. Given the large proportion of critical care delivered in the community setting, our purpose was to determine the impact of extubation failure on patient outcomes in a community hospital ICU. Methods: A retrospective cohort study was performed using data gathered in a 16-bed medical/surgical ICU in a community hospital. During 30 months, all patients with acute respiratory failure admitted to the ICU were included in the source population if they were mechanically ventilated by endotracheal tube for more than 12 hours. Extubation failure was defined as reinstitution of mechanical ventilation within 72 hours (n = 60), and the control cohort included patients who were successfully extubated at 72 hours (n = 93). Results: The primary outcome was total ICU length of stay after the initial extubation. Secondary outcomes were total hospital length of stay after the initial extubation, ICU mortality, hospital mortality, and total hospital cost. Patient groups were similar in terms of age, sex, and severity of illness, as assessed using admission Acute Physiology and Chronic Health Evaluation II score (P > 0.05). Both ICU (1.0 versus 10 days; P < 0.01) and hospital length of stay (6.0 versus 17 days; P < 0.01) after initial extubation were significantly longer in reintubated patients. ICU mortality was significantly higher in patients who failed extubation (odds ratio = 12.2, 95% confidence interval [CI] = 1.5ï¿½101; P < 0.05), but there was no significant difference in hospital mortality (odds ratio = 2.1, 95% CI = 0.8ï¿½5.4; P < 0.15). Total hospital costs (estimated from direct and indirect charges) were significantly increased by a mean of US$33,926 (95% CI = US$22,573ï¿½45,280; P < 0.01). Conclusion: Extubation failure in a community hospital is univariately associated with prolonged inpatient care and significantly increased cost. Corroborating data from tertiary care centers, these adverse outcomes highlight the importance of accurate predictors of extubation outcome.

2. Elevated White Cell Count in Acute Coronary Syndromes: Relationship to Variants in Inflammatory and Thrombotic Genes. Byrne CE, Fitzgerald A, Cannon CP, Fitzgerald DJ, Shields DC. BMC Medical Genetics 2004, 5:13 (1 June 2004) Background: Elevated white blood cell counts (WBC) in acute coronary syndromes (ACS) increase the risk of recurrent events, but it is not known if this is exacerbated by pro-inflammatory factors. We sought to identify whether pro-inflammatory genetic variants contributed to alterations in WBC and C-reactive protein (CRP) in an ACS population. Methods: WBC and genotype of interleukin 6 (IL-6 G-174C) and of interleukin-1 receptor antagonist (IL1RN intronic repeat polymorphism) were investigated in 732 Caucasian patients with ACS in the OPUS-TIMI-16 trial. Samples for measurement of WBC and inflammatory factors were taken at baseline, i.e. Within 72 hours of an acute myocardial infarction or an unstable angina event. Results: An increased white blood cell count (WBC) was associated with an increased C-reactive protein (r = 0.23, p < 0.001) and there was also a positive correlation between levels of β-fibrinogen and C-reactive protein (r = 0.42, p < 0.0001). IL1RN and IL6 genotypes had no significant impact upon WBC. The difference in median WBC between the two homozygote IL6 genotypes was 0.21/mm3 (95% CI = -0.41, 0.77), and -0.03/mm3 (95% CI = -0.55, 0.86) for IL1RN. Moreover, the composite endpoint was not significantly affected by an interaction between WBC and the IL1 (p = 0.61) or IL6 (p = 0.48) genotype. Conclusions: Cytokine pro-inflammatory genetic variants do not influence the increased inflammatory profile of ACS patients.

3. Is There a Clinically Significant Gender Bias in Post-Myocardial Infarction Pharmacological Management in the Older (>60) Population of a Primary Care Practice? Di Cecco R, Patel U, Upshur REG. BMC Family Practice 2002, 3:8 (3 May 2002) Background: Differences in the management of coronary artery disease between men and women have been reported in the literature. There are few studies of potential inequalities of treatment that arise from a primary care context. This study investigated the existence of such inequalities in the medical management of post myocardial infarction in older patients. Methods: A comprehensive chart audit was conducted of 142 men and 81 women in an academic primary care practice. Variables were extracted on demographic variables, cardiovascular risk factors, medical and non-medical management of myocardial infarction. Results: Women were older than men. The groups were comparable in terms of cardiac risk factors. A statistically significant difference (14.6%: 95% CI 0.048ï¿½28.7 p = 0.047) was found between men and women for the prescription of lipid lowering medications. 25.3% (p = 0.0005, CI 11.45, 39.65) more men than women had undergone angiography, and 14.4 % (p = 0.029, CI 2.2, 26.6) more men than women had undergone coronary artery bypass graft surgery. Conclusion: Women are less likely than men to receive lipid-lowering medication which may indicate less aggressive secondary prevention in the primary care setting.

### Additional topics

* As another aside, I was involved with a similar study (prospective, not retrospective). We planned this study using a one-sided hypothesis (remote prayer has a positive effect on health). The Institutional Review Board suggested changing this to a two-sided hypothesis (remote prayer has either a positive or a negative effect on health). Thankfully, we did not observe an outcome in the opposite tail as that would have been very difficult to explain.

### Data Collection Techniques 

+ Standardized vs Investigator-Developed Instruments
	+ Development and Use
	+ Evidence to support investigator-developed instruments

<div class="notes">

There is a lot of work in the development of standardized instruments, manual and documentaiton, normative values, apply to a broad area. Investigator developed instruments focus on a more specialized area, but you still need to supply information on validity and reliability.

Whenever possible use instruments already in use. You can find these in places like PROQOLID. This originally started as quality of life measurements, but has expanded. NIH compilation of patient reported outcome measures (PROMIS). NIH wants the research community to use common measures to allow easier compilation of studies in a meta-analysis.

</div>

***
### Data Collection Techniques 

+ Researcher-Observed Measures
	+ Naturalness of the setting
	+ Observer “participation”
	+ Amount of detail
	+ Breadth of coverage

<div class="notes">

The focus is on direct observation. The more natural the setting, the less control you have. This might hurt the internal validity of the study. It is a trade-off.

How much does the observer participate. In interviews and focus groups, there is a very clear high level of participation. On the other extreme, observation in public places might not have any knowledge of their participation. In the middle are studies where participants know they are being observed, but this knowledge may fade into the background.

</div>

### Data Collection Techniques 

+ Tests and Documents
	+ Standardized tests
		+ Norm referenced test
		+ Criterion referenced test
	+ Achievement tests
	+ Performance and Authentic assessments
	+ Aptitude tests
	+ Documents
	+ Content analysis

<div class="notes">

Norm scores allow you to compare to other scores (historical comparisons). These tests are very objective, but there is some subjectivity, perhaps, in their interpretation.

Measuring actual performance (ecologic validity). Tries to be very relevant to the setting.

Use existing documents. Existing records might have a higher level of accuracy but there is no gauarantee. Time is shorter because the documents already exist. Data extraction takes time. Do you need consent from the people associated with these documents.

Data abstraction is tedious, but the newer systems like i2b2 allow you to get the information more directly.

Content analysis is a more qualitative review. It gives you a lot of valuable information that a quantitative approach might miss.

	+ Interviews
	+ Focus groups

<div class="notes">

Personality inventories: the validity is dependent on an individual's self-awareness.

Attitudes and beliefs done for a variety of purposes. A "representative sample of all possible opinions or attitudes about a particularl subject." That's why measurement experts cringe when you ask a single question. You need a multiple set of items to get at how people feel.

The Likert scale is very popular. You may not see the semantic difference scale, but examples will follow.

Delivery by mail or Internet. There are pros and cons to all formats. Item types could include open ended, partial (responses plus other), and close ended responses.

Even as simple as something like age, you can ask it in an open ended format that allows you to categorize any way you like or even to forgo categorization.

Wording is important. Simplicity and reading level. Use standardized scales whenever you can. 

Double-barreled questions. [[Ask option about supervisors and managers]]

How many times questions, think about the time frame (over the past 24 hours, past week, past month). Shorter time frames better recall, but subject to more external variations.

Building a level of trust. Don't ask people to admit to "bad behavior". Think of it from the perspective of the person providing the information.

Tools: semi-structured interviews, participant observation, photo elicitation(?), mapping exercises(?), web and space design workshops(?), archival records, physical artifacts, 

Typically, a one-hour interview requires a minimum of three to four hours (or more) of analysis.

Involve the participants in the process, especially for narrative research.

### Analysis of Qualitative Data 

+ Inductive process –
	+ Start with the specific (raw data / transcript)
	+ Develop a theoretical framework from the data
	+ Conceptual categories emerge from the data

<div class="notes">



</div>


### Analysis of Qualitative Data 

+ Start the study with a research question
	+ This may provide a potential starting point for analyzing text
	+ If you do this, DO NOT let it prevent you from seeing what is in the text
+ Steps
	+ From raw data to theory building
	+ “ Iterative ” process
		+ e.g. , as you are developing categories, check them back against the raw data – do they continue to reflect the original data?

<div class="notes">

Keep alert and look for things that come out in the material that you were not anticipating. As your categories, go back and compare them against the raw data. Make sure that you allow the data to guide you. Often coding from transcripts. But it is also good to have access to the original recordings. Sometimes there is a doubt about what some was saying (joking or sarcasm). Look for tone of voice and non-verbal cues.

Content analysis is a generic term, but you can look at things like ad messages in magazines that appeal to young adults.

Thematic analysis is looking for patterns.

</div>


### Analysis of Qualitative Data 

+ Analysis process –
	+ Given research question, may have some idea of a general conceptual structure; serve only as a starting point
	+ Usually work from transcripts
	+ If possible, refer back to audio recordings when needed
	+ Qualitative form of analysis
		+ Content analysis – analysis of the content of communication
		+ Thematic analysis – identifying patterns or themes in the data

<div class="notes">

Break up the text into "bits" that represent specific thoughts. Open coding lots of themes. Axial coding looks at the relationships between themes, builds a superstructure of ideas.

</div>


### Analysis of Qualitative Data 

+ Category Formation – assign sections (data bits) to analytical categories/themes "coding"
	+ Summarizing the data by identifying similarities and differences / commonalities and contrasts
	+ Categories:
		+ More manageable units of information
		+ "open coding"
		+ Descriptive – Concrete
		+ Interpretive – Abstract
		+ Relational
	+ Cross-reference categories back to text
		+ Makes it easier to revise coding as needed

<div class="notes">

Software allows you to go back and forth between themes and the original text. Cross-referencing is important. Find examples easily. It helps provide validity checks. Does someone agree with your categorization.

Categories need to be faithful to the data. This is internal validity. But you need to place this in a broader understanding.

You need to be careful about trying to quantify this too much. Keep in mind that just because someone talks about something a lot does not mean that this is the most important thing to them. The most important thing might be something that people are uncomfortable talking about.

	+ Member-generated – “ first-order ” account
	+ Observer-generated – “ second-order ” account
	+ Labels are provisional; may be revised
	+ Iteration – move back and forth between raw data and labeled categories
	+ “ Zoom in ” vs “ Wide angle ” view of the coding
	+ Revision – may end up dividing or combining categories
	+ May establish criteria for category coding

<div class="notes">

Phrasing of the person versus observations generated by the researcher. Labels should be considered as provisional as you work with more complete information. It is an iterative process. Go back to original data. You're looking at the specific of what's been told versus a broader understanding.

Establishing the criteria may depend on how many people are doing the coding. If you don't have a pre-existing structure, the coding may evolve and may involve 100% review (both raters review everything and resolve discrepancy). Then a third person does an audit.

### Analysis of Qualitative Data 

+ Saturation – the point at which you are not gaining any new insight, no new categories being identified, no new relationships being defined
	+ Don't need any additional analysis
	+ Don't need any additional data collection (if collection & analysis done in parallel)
	+ Determinant – nature of the information being collection – NOT amount of information
	+ Keeping notes – of the coding/analysis process
	+ Help identify categories/relationships
	+ Help if "stuck"
	+ Document analysis process

<div class="notes">

Saturation is a way to assess your sample size. Have you gotten a representative amount of data. 

Really important to keep notes of the coding and analysis process, so you can check your work. Allows you to do qualirty checks on the process.

</div>


### Analysis of Qualitative Data 

+ Role of Judgment
	+ Balancing act –
		+ Level of creativity by coder to identify categories/relationships
		+ Must reflect the informants thoughts
		+ Audit of the coding by an independent person can check for the match between the coding and the source information
	+ Low-inference descriptors
	+ Look for "negative cases"

<div class="notes">

You develop a framework, but that framework must always represent what the subjects have said.

Low inference descriptors are those things involving just the basic words or text.

The standard deviation is considered a poor measure of variability for a non-normal population. The interquartile is the difference between the 75th percentile and the 25th percentile. Define the 25th percentile as the value so that approximately 25% of the values are smaller and 75% are larger.

### Making Inferences - NHST 

+ Populations versus Samples
+ Use inferential statistics
	+ Sample statistics (M, SD) <U+F0E8>
	+ Population parameters (mu, sigma)
+ Null Hypothesis Significance Testing (NHST)
	+ Null hypothesis (H 0 )
	+ Alternative hypothesis (H 1 )
		+ AKA research hypothesis
		+ Directional
		+ Non-directional

<div class="notes">

We are talking about data analysis and interpretation. Planning. Some of this will be familiar to you. This is not a full statistical coverage of the topic.

Take the data from the sample and make inferences about the population. The sample is a subset. Inferential statistics is the process by which you infer information about the population.

NHST is the traditional way that a huge amount of research relies on.

Null hypothesis is no difference or no relationship. The alternative is often called the research hypothesis.

</div>

***
### Making Inferences - NHST 

+ NHST – Goal of research –
	+ Reject the H 0 in favor of H 1
+ “Reject” the null hypothesis
	+ Practically – “reject” means difference / relationship greater than just random variability
+ Alternative hypothesis –
	+ 3 versions
		+ Non-directional
		+ Directional positive
		+ Directional negative

<div class="notes">

Does the data allow us to reject the null hypothesis. Rejecting means the difference or relationship is greater than what you'd expect due to sampling error.

[[Directional only for two group comparisons or bivariate relationships]]

never talk about proving the null hypothesis. A large p-value does not mean that you proved the null hypothesis. There might be sources of error that lead to failure to reject the null hypothesis.

		+ Statistical analysis
		+ Interpretation

<div class="notes">

Directional is more likely when comparing a treatment to a control [[placebo]]. When comparing two different treatments, you would have to use a non-directional hypothesis.

Is there existing evidence to support a directional hypothesis.

If you use a directional hypothesis, and you get an extreme result in the opposite direction, you can't claim statistical significance.

Some people think that directional hypotheses are "cheating".

Tools: semi-structured interviews, participant observation, photo elicitation(?), mapping exercises(?), web and space design workshops(?), archival records, physical artifacts, 

Typically, a one-hour interview requires a minimum of three to four hours (or more) of analysis.

Involve the participants in the process, especially for narrative research.

### Analysis of Qualitative Data 

+ Inductive process –
	+ Start with the specific (raw data / transcript)
	+ Develop a theoretical framework from the data
	+ Conceptual categories emerge from the data

<div class="notes">



</div>


### Analysis of Qualitative Data 

+ Start the study with a research question
	+ This may provide a potential starting point for analyzing text
	+ If you do this, DO NOT let it prevent you from seeing what is in the text
+ Steps
	+ From raw data to theory building
	+ “ Iterative ” process
		+ e.g. , as you are developing categories, check them back against the raw data – do they continue to reflect the original data?

<div class="notes">

Keep alert and look for things that come out in the material that you were not anticipating. As your categories, go back and compare them against the raw data. Make sure that you allow the data to guide you. Often coding from transcripts. But it is also good to have access to the original recordings. Sometimes there is a doubt about what some was saying (joking or sarcasm). Look for tone of voice and non-verbal cues.

Content analysis is a generic term, but you can look at things like ad messages in magazines that appeal to young adults.

Thematic analysis is looking for patterns.

</div>


### Analysis of Qualitative Data 

+ Analysis process –
	+ Given research question, may have some idea of a general conceptual structure; serve only as a starting point
	+ Usually work from transcripts
	+ If possible, refer back to audio recordings when needed
	+ Qualitative form of analysis
		+ Content analysis – analysis of the content of communication
		+ Thematic analysis – identifying patterns or themes in the data

<div class="notes">

Break up the text into "bits" that represent specific thoughts. Open coding lots of themes. Axial coding looks at the relationships between themes, builds a superstructure of ideas.

</div>


### Analysis of Qualitative Data 

+ Category Formation – assign sections (data bits) to analytical categories/themes "coding"
	+ Summarizing the data by identifying similarities and differences / commonalities and contrasts
	+ Categories:
		+ More manageable units of information
		+ "open coding"
		+ Descriptive – Concrete
		+ Interpretive – Abstract
		+ Relational
	+ Cross-reference categories back to text
		+ Makes it easier to revise coding as needed

<div class="notes">

Software allows you to go back and forth between themes and the original text. Cross-referencing is important. Find examples easily. It helps provide validity checks. Does someone agree with your categorization.

Categories need to be faithful to the data. This is internal validity. But you need to place this in a broader understanding.

You need to be careful about trying to quantify this too much. Keep in mind that just because someone talks about something a lot does not mean that this is the most important thing to them. The most important thing might be something that people are uncomfortable talking about.

</div>


### Analysis of Qualitative Data 

+ Category Formation
	+ Faithful to the data – "internal" aspect
	+ Meaningful to other categories – "external" aspect
	+ Balance
		+ Generality vs Specificity
		+ Inclusivity vs Exclusivity
	+ Number of times idea mentioned does NOT necessarily reflect importance

### Analysis of Qualitative Data 

+ Labeling / Revising Categories
	+ Member-generated – “ first-order ” account
	+ Observer-generated – “ second-order ” account
	+ Labels are provisional; may be revised
	+ Iteration – move back and forth between raw data and labeled categories
	+ “ Zoom in ” vs “ Wide angle ” view of the coding
	+ Revision – may end up dividing or combining categories
	+ May establish criteria for category coding

Phrasing of the person versus observations generated by the researcher. Labels should be considered as provisional as you work with more complete information. It is an iterative process. Go back to original data. You're looking at the specific of what's been told versus a broader understanding.

+ Null Hypothesis Significance Testing (NHST)
	+ Null hypothesis (H 0 )
	+ Alternative hypothesis (H 1 )

		+ Directional
		+ Non-directional

<div class="notes">

We are talking about data analysis and interpretation. Planning. Some of this will be familiar to you. This is not a full statistical coverage of the topic.

Take the data from the sample and make inferences about the population. The sample is a subset. Inferential statistics is the process by which you infer information about the population.

NHST is the traditional way that a huge amount of research relies on.

Null hypothesis is no difference or no relationship. The alternative is often called the research hypothesis.

</div>

### Making Inferences - NHST 

+ NHST – Goal of research –
	+ Reject the H 0 in favor of H 1
+ “Reject” the null hypothesis
	+ Practically – “reject” means difference / relationship greater than just random variability
+ Alternative hypothesis –
	+ 3 versions
		+ Non-directional
		+ Directional positive
		+ Directional negative

<div class="notes">

Does the data allow us to reject the null hypothesis. Rejecting means the difference or relationship is greater than what you'd expect due to sampling error.

[[Directional only for two group comparisons or bivariate relationships]]

never talk about proving the null hypothesis. A large p-value does not mean that you proved the null hypothesis. There might be sources of error that lead to failure to reject the null hypothesis.

<div class="notes">

Directional is more likely when comparing a treatment to a control [[placebo]]. When comparing two different treatments, you would have to use a non-directional hypothesis.

Is there existing evidence to support a directional hypothesis.

If you use a directional hypothesis, and you get an extreme result in the opposite direction, you can't claim statistical significance.

Some people think that directional hypotheses are "cheating".

### Additional topics

* As another aside, I was involved with a similar study (prospective, not retrospective). We planned this study using a one-sided hypothesis (remote prayer has a positive effect on health). The Institutional Review Board suggested changing this to a two-sided hypothesis (remote prayer has either a positive or a negative effect on health). Thankfully, we did not observe an outcome in the opposite tail as that would have been very difficult to explain.
