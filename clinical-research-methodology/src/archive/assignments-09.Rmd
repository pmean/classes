### Assignments for this week

* Q09. Complete the quiz on the canvas website.

* (Not for credit). Start thinking about a methods section for your research question. In particular, what variables to you plan to collect? Which one(s) would warrant reliability or validity assessments? What information can you glean from the literature on reliability and validity. Note: it is okay to do research on "hard" measurements that do not require extensive reliability or validity checks. Also, review the material from the previous week and use it to describe the type of sample you will be using.

### Discussion questions for this week

* D09-01. `r read_text("minute-paper")`

* D09-02. (Two points) Find a paper that provides an extensive study of the validity and/or reliability of a measurement. Hint: do a PubMed search, but restrict yourself to articles where the words "validity" or "reliability" appear in the title. Provide a three or four sentence summary. List the types of reliability and/or validity that the paper uses. Include a link, if the article is available openly, or attach a copy if it is not openly available. 

* D09-EC. `r read_text("extra-credit")`
