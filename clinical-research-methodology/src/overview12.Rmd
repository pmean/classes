This is a list of assignments, readings, and discussion questions for module`r wk`. This module should be released sometime during the week starting on `r mon[no]`, but if it is delayed, I will adjust all the deadlines appropriately. Please complete all work by the stated deadlines to receive full credit.

**If you notice a discrepancy between this overview and what appears on the Canvas website, please contact me. But do note that the Canvas website always takes precence over this overview.**
