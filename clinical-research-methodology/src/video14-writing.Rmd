### Research grant process

+ Read the solicitation and guidelines
+ Build a research team
+ Submit a letter of intent, if asked
+ Prepare a draft proposal
+ Get internal reviewers and administrative approval
+ Submit proposal and wait

<div class="notes">

Every research grant is different, but here are the general steps that most grants follow.

</div>

### Read the solicitation and guidelines

+ Solicitation
  + BAA, RFA, RFP, others
  + List of what you can/cannot propose
  + Allowable expenses
  + Deadline
+ Guidelines
  + Proposal length
  + Proposal structure

<div class="notes">

I'm going to describe the granting process from the perspective of the National Institutes of Health. There are other governmental agencies that distribute grant money for research, such as the Department of Defense and the National Science Foundation. Grants are also available from private organizations, such as the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation and the American Heart Association. 

Almost all grant opportunities are described in some type of solicitation. It may be called a Broad Agency Announcement (BAA), Request for Applications (RFA), or Request for Proposals (RFP). These are the NIH terms, but other granting agencies will probably use different acronyms.

The solicitation will provide a list of what you can propose. It is sometimes very specific, but at times it is open ended with examples but allows for other options.

The important thing, however, is that you must, must, must pay attention to what you cannot do. If you can't run a clinical trial, don't propose a clinical trial.

Also look at the list of allowable expenses. Can you use the money for travel? Can you use it for the purchase of computer equipment?

Also note the deadline. You should start work on a grant two or three months prior to the deadline.

### Build a research team

+ "No man is an island" John Donne
+ Find researchers with the skills you lack
  + Brag about them
  + Brag about yourself

<div class="notes">

I want to start with the famous quote by John Donne: no man is an island. You could also say that no researcher is an island. Many centuries ago, there were great scientists who could do it all by themselves: Benjamin Franklin, Isaac Newton, Marie Curie. Times have changed and science has become so diverse that no one person can do it all.

So your job as the grant writer is to build a team, with each person providing specialized skills that you lack.

Your job in the grant is to brag about your team. Don't be shy here. Your team is the best and is the most capable of conducting this research.

Don't forget to brag about yourself. Even if you are relatively new to research, you have some training in classes like this one and you also have job experiences related to the work you are proposing. Let the reviewers know about this. Don't make up stuff, of course, but do put in anything you can think about yourself that makes you look special.

### Build a research team, patient accrual model (1/2)

+ Accrual = how fast you can recruit patients
+ Criticized on software development angle
  + Failure to mention my expertise
  + Failure to recruit other experts
  

<div class="notes">

A few years ago, I proposed a research grant that proposed, among other things, to develop some software to help researchers plan their accrual rates. Accrual is the speed at which you expect to recruit patients into your clinical trial. Accrual is the flip side of sample size calculation. It make no sense to propose a sample size of 500 patients if it would take two decades to find that many volunteers.

The grant was not funded, and when I got feedback, one major deficiency was that no one on the research team was familiar with software development. So this provided me with two lessons. 

First, I did not brag enough about how much I know about software development. Now I am not an expert in software development, but I am not a total novice either. But I didn't describe my skills in this area. So remember to always brag about yourself.

Second, I knew some experts in software development through my work with the Kansas City R Users Group. In particular, I knew someone who was an expert in testing user interfaces. So I talked to him and said, described the grant, and asked for his help when I prepared a resubmission. I did not end up resubmitting because of competing time commitments, but the lesson still holds.

</div>

### Build a research team, patient accrual model (2/2)

![](../images/grant-lenth.png)

<div class="notes">

Actually, I did get praise for including a researcher, Russ Lenth, who was the pre-eminent expert on sample size calculation. As I mentioned, accrual is the neglected partner of sample size calculation, and Dr. Lenth provided a level of technical expertise that the reviewers noted and commented on favorably.

Let me share a second story. This one was about another unsuccessful grant. Again, one thing I did well was to develop a strong research team.

There was a call for developing training modules for biomedical researchers. Right up my alley, I thought to myself. Now I need to be careful because there are a lot of people who are far better at developing courses than I am. But I do provide some unique skills that set me apart. In particular, I am very good at finding interesting datasets that can be used as exercises or teaching examples.

There has been a lot of interest recently in data sharing. There is an increasing push for researchers to include their datasets along with any peer reviewed publication. There are privacy concerns, of course, with many datasets. Even so, there are ways to protect patient privacy and still share the data.

So I wanted to propose a series of training videos on the issues associated with data sharing--issues like documentation, which are often overlooked. Now part of my job was to assemble a research team.

One of the first steps was to involve an expert in curriculum development.

The second step was to identify someone who could provide an evaluation of the curriculum.

### Build a research team, peer-reviewed datasets (3/4)

<div class="notes">

THe third step was to recruit a librarian. I actually ended up with two librarians.

### Build a research team, peer-reviewed datasets (4/4)

Here is the second librarian.

</div>

### Submit a letter of intent, if asked

+ Very brief description

### Elements of a research proposal

+ Literature review
+ Methods section
+ Preliminary data
  + Proof of your capabilities
  + Not always available
+ Strengths of the research team
  
<div class="notes">

Broadly speaking, you already know the bulk of what is needed for a research grant. You summarize what is already known and the propose methods to add to what we know.

The third element in most grants is discussion of preliminary data. Preliminary data is data that you yourself have collected. It isn't data that addresses your proposed research. Otherwise you wouldn't need money--the work is already done. Preliminary data is data that shows that you have been an active participant in this research area. It demonstrates that you have proven yourself capable of doing research along the same lines of what you propose in your methods section.

You would summarize your preliminary data the same way that you summarize other people's work with two exceptions. First, you spend a lot more time and discuss your own work in a lot more detail. Second, you include preliminary data, even if it has not been published yet.

Some grants require you to have preliminary data. If you don't have it, you will get a tepid review. Other grants do not require preliminary data. Even when the grant solicitations or guidelines states that preliminary data is not needed, it does help to present it when you have it.  

You also need to convince the reviewers
