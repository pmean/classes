#### D09-01. One minute feedback

Graded: 3 points, one point deduction if submitted after the due date.

Take one minute after viewing the videos to answer these three questions. Don't take more than a minute and don't over think this. It's okay to provide very short answers (like "nothing" or "everything" for the second question). You can save a bit of time by responding with a "me too" comment if you agree with a previous discussion comment.
