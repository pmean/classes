#### D02-EC. Find a paper related to the responsible conduct of research and comment on it

Extra credit: 1 point.

Find a peer-reviewed article or an article in the popular press on research methodology that relates to the responsible conduct of research. Cut-and-paste the title and abstract (if it has one) into the discussion board. It could be a case study of a research scandal or a survey of questionable research practices. 

Please do not include any articles that are listed in the readings for this class or any articles that you have found on my website or blog. Do not use the same article that you commented on in an earlier discussion board.

Post a brief summary in your own words of what this guideline covers.

Post a link to the full free text, or attach a PDF of the article if it is not readily available to the general public.
