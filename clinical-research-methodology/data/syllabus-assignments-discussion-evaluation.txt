### Discussion forums

All students are expected to complete the readings prior to class and be prepared for discussion. A portion of the course grade will be based on discussion board participation. For each class session, participation points will be assigned based on the following scale:

* 0 points (did not participate),

* 1 point (made minimal contribution to discussion and did not respond to others' postings),

* 2 points (posted own comment and responded to another student's posting), or

* 3 points (interactively participated in discussions and made initial posting by Sunday midnight).

To get maximum participation credit, you must make your initial posting by Sunday midnight, make an original posting to one of the discussion forums, and respond to at least one posting by another student.

Students will be assigned to lead discussions; participation credit will take into account this activity.
