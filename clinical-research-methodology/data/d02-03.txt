#### D02-03. What is your research problem?

Graded: 3 points, no due date, so no deduction for a late submission.

Start thinking about a research problem that you might want to develop a research plan for. If you can identify one now, post it on the discussion board for this week (I'll keep the discussion board open if it takes you several weeks to settle on a research problem). If you want to run your research problem by me first, send it by email and I will offer some feedback. It's okay to change your research problem if you find out something new in the lectures or readings or as you begin to work on the plan for this research problem.

There is no official due date, but please try to identify your problem early so you can get started on your literature review.
