### Final Project Written Research Proposal

The final project for the class will be a written research proposal which must be turned in using "Turnitin" through Canvas by midnight on <<due date>>; turning in the proposal after this date/time will result in an automatic deduction in points. The structure of the written proposal should follow a truncated version of the five-chapter thesis format. For this project, the written proposal is expected to include the following major sections: introduction to the problem (chapter 1), review of the literature (chapter 2), and description of the methodology (chapter 3). More detailed information concerning expectations for this written proposal will be covered later in the semester. The Grading Rubric for the written research proposal is posted in the "Course Content" section of the course Canvas site.

Note: The School of Graduate Studies has prepared a guide for formatting Theses and Dissertations. This guide provides information on the general format of a thesis or dissertation, but does not have detailed information regarding the structure and content of individual chapters â€“ this information varies depending on discipline.
