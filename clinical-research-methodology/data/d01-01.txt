#### D01-01. Introduce yourself

Graded: 3 points, 1 point deduction if late.

Briefly describe your background and explain why are you interested in this course. It's optional, but I'd also be interested in hearing about something you do (a hobby, or other activity) that is totally unrelated to research.
