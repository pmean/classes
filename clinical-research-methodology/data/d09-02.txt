#### D09-02. Find a validity/reliability example and comment on it.

Graded: 3 points, one point deduction if submitted after the due date.

Find a paper that provides an extensive study of the validity and/or reliability of a measurement. Hint: do a PubMed search, but restrict yourself to articles where the words "validity" or "reliability" appear in the title. Cut-and-paste the title and abstract (if it has one) into the discussion board. This should be a research study and not a tutorial or methodology paper.

Do not use the same article that you commented on in an earlier discussion board.

Post a brief summary in your own words of what methods the authors used to establish reliability and/or validity.

Post a link to the full free text, or attach a PDF of the article if it is not readily available to the general public.
