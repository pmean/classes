### Answers for quiz04.

1. For what reason would you want to use sealed envelopes in a randomized study?

To prevent the recruiting physicians from subverting the randomization process by steering some of their patients to a preferred treatment arm in a study.

2. What is the problem with alternating treatment assignments (ABABAB) compared to randomization?

In many settings, a sequence of patients will exhibit an alternating pattern of large values followed by small values and vice versa. If this happens, alternating treatment assignments will show a difference that is purely an artefact of the selection process.
 
3. True or False. Randomization protects you against covariate imbalance in both measured and unmeasured covariates.

True
 
4. Name one setting where you cannot or would not want to use randomization.

There are many possible answers here. It is impractical to use randomization for a disease that has a long latency period, such as many types of cancer.

5. Intention to treat analysis is quite controversial. List one reason why some researchers prefer to use this approach.

There are several answers here that would be acceptable. You might want to use intention to treat analysis because it preserves the advantages of randomization and it provides a more realistic estimate of a treatment effect that is difficult to tolerate and might cause a substantial drop out rate.
