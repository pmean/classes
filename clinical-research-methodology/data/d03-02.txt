#### D03-02. How will you organize your literature review?

Graded: 3 points, one point deduction if submitted after the due date.

You have the choice of index cards, a spreadsheet, or bibliographic management software to organize your literature review. You don't have to commit to any of these now, but find a website or article that talks about the notecard or spreadsheet approach or which offers a positive review of a bibliographic software program. Share a link and offer a brief summary (three to four sentences).
