#### D10-01. Review these resources on case report forms and list the best suggestion.

Graded: 3 points, one point deduction if submitted after the due date.

I left an important section out of this module, and it is a big, big oversight. I should have had a section on case report forms. Case report forms are a way to standardize your data collection in a prospective clinical trial. If it is designed well, it will speed up the data collection, improve data quality, and simplify the data analysis. At the bottom of this page are three resources that discuss principles for designing a good case report form.

Review one or more of these resources. State the one most valuable lesson that you learned.

Note: I normally do not recommend slide shows because they leave too many details out. These two are exceptions to that rule.
