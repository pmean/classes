### D02-01. Comment on one of the recommended readings for this week.

Graded: 3 points, one point deduction if submitted after the due date.

There are several [recommended readings](http://www.pmean.com/clinical-research-methods/overview02.html#recommended) in this module. Select one and offer a brief commentary (three or four sentences is fine). 

Your commentary could be identifying who is the "hero" and who is the "villain" or suggesting what might have been done differently. You might comment on an experience that you have had that relates to the case study (but please don't share anything that should be kept confidential).

You are also welcome (and encouraged) to respond to someone else's commentary rather than providing your own original commentary, though please do this respectfully. Also make sure that your comments are constructive and add something of value to the discussion.
