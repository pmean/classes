## Planning a research project

![](../images/gliner-figure-2-1.png)

::: notes
This figure from your book provides a nice overview of the research process. The first two steps, identifying a research problem and conducting a literature review are steps we will discuss today. Actually, we will not discuss the literature review today. The remaining steps are topics for later weeks. This table includes the chapters associated with each step.

Now this class will not follow this flow chart exactly, but it will come close.

The process is for a quantitative study, but it still closely matches the process that you would use for a qualitative study. Certainly the literature review, setting up a research hypothesis (if you have one), and the human subjects review are pretty much the same no matter what the type of study.
:::

## Step 1: Identify a research problem

-   Chapter 2 of Gliner et al
-   Week 2 of this class

::: notes
The first step in this flow chart is to identify your research problem. We talked a bit about this in the first week of class and we will talk a bit more about it this week as well. Keep in mind that there is no approach that is uniformly good or uniformly bad. A good researcher should be comfortable with both qualitative and quantitative methods, with applied and theoretical research, with field and laboratory studies, and so forth. You pick the approach that best fits the problem. Don't sneer at other types of research. That's bad, bad, bad.
:::

## Step 2: Conduct a literature review

-   Chapter 2 of Gliner et al
-   Various web resources
-   Week 3 of this class

::: notes
The second step is to conduct a literature review. This is also covered in Chapter 2 of your book. There are also some very good web resources as well. 

We will cover this topic in week 3. The key thing to keep in mind is that your literature review has to flow. It needs a direction: from general to specific, for example.
:::

## Step 3: Write research objectives, questions, or hypotheses

-   Chapter 3 of Gliner et al
-   Week 2 of this class
-   PICO format
-   Research without a research hypothesis

::: notes
The next step is specifying your research hypothesis. Not every research study has a research hypothesis, but it it does, you should structure it using the PICO format (Patient group, Intervention, Control group, and Outcomes). We'll talk more about the research hypothesis and research that does not need a research hypothesis in this week's lecture.
:::

## Step 4: Select the research approach

-   Randomized experiments (Chapter 5, Week 4)
-   Quasi experimental designs (Chapters 5, 6, Week 5)
-   Observational designs (Chapter 7, Week 6)

::: notes
There are three different research approaches that you can choose from.

We will spend three full weeks on this, because the topic is so important. 

In a randomized experiment, you control who gets what, and you use a random device, typically a computer random number generator. In a quasi-experimental design, you have less control over who gets what, and the choices are made without the benefits of randomization.

Now I have to be honest, quasiexperimental designs have a bad reputation. I'm going to try to disabuse you of that notion. Quasiexperimental designs--the word "quasi" seems almost critical of this type of the approach. Really what a quasiexperimental design is the design that reflects the reality of the difficulties associated with doing research in a variety of different settings.

In an observational study, you do not control the assignment of patients into the groups being studied. The patients themselves control who gets what, or the choice is beyond the control of anyone.
:::

## Step 5: Create a plan for your research

-   Sampling issues (Chapter 9, Week 8)
-   Measurement issues (Chapters 10-12, Week 9)

::: notes

Your research plan should mention how you get your sample, which we will cover in Week 7 and how you measure variables, which we is what we'll cover in Week 8.

:::

## Step 6: Obtain ethical approval

-   Chapter 14 of Gliner et al.
-   Week 2 of this class.
-   Think about ethical issues from the very start.

::: notes
Your book places the material on ethical conduct fairly late in the book, but we will cover it very early (this week) because ethical conduct will often influence choices in your research hypothesis and your research design.
:::

## Step 7: Collect your data

-   Chapters 13, 15 of Gliner et al
-   Week 10, 11

::: notes
Boy, we're getting into it. Collecting your data takes a lot of time and if you don't plan for this well, a lot of the time will be wasted in rework.

How you collect your data will depend in a large part on what type of data you collect. Qualitative data, of course, is in a world all it's own. Within quantitative data, though, you need to think about collection issues for self-report data versus investigator collected data. A codebook is vital, especially if you are doing the data entry yourself.

I've not done a lot of qualitative research but I've read a lot about it and advocate its use whenever I think it is appropriate.
:::

## Step 8: Analyze your data

-   Chapters 16-22 of Gliner et al.
-   Week 12, 13 of this class.
  
::: notes
This class is not a course in data analysis, but I do want to give you enough information so you can write a decent data analysis plan. You'll learn about the foundations of inferential statistics and five common modeling approaches (linear regression, logistic regression, analysis of two by two crosstabulations, analysis of variance, and survival models)
:::

## Step 9: Communicate findings; write manuscript

-   Chapter 26 of Gliner et al.
-   Week 14.
    -   Written paper
    -   Oral presentation
    -   Poster presentation
    -   Research grants
  
::: notes
Research is not complete until you disseminate your findings. The different formats (written paper, oral presentation, and poster presentation) have fairly standardized formats. You'll also get an overview of how to write a research grant.

As the class goes along, if there is a particular topic that you want me to spend more time on, I'm happy to do it.

If I can brag here a bit, there is no one in the Kansas City area who understands the research process as well as I do. There are some very good people, including Mary Gerkovich, who I have leaned on to produce this class. There are people who have greater depth--they know more about one or two areas than I do. But no one else has the breadth of knowledge that I do. It comes in part with being old. There's nothing that I haven't seen before. Also a big part of it is that I understand the research process from a very fundamental and very foundational level.

In particular, if there is something you are interested in, please, please, please get that information to you. I will present that information, either formally in this class or informally outside of this class.
