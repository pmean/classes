## What is a population?

* A group of people or objects that share one or more common features.
  + Demography
  + Geography
  + Occupation
  + Time
  + Care requirements
  + Diagnosis

::: notes

A population is a group of people or objects, but in this class, we'll almost always talk about people. There are a few exceptions. Some of the problems that we study involve a population of hospital visits and that is not quite the same thing as a population of people who visit hospitals because some people visit a hospital more than once.

The population shares one or more common features. I got this list somewhere and I can't remember where, but it is a great list of the common characteristics of a population, from the perspective of health care.

## What is a sampling frame

* Physical list
  + Ideally everyone or almost everyone in population
  + Used to draw your sample
* Expensive, not always available.
* Example: Master Address File.

::: notes

A sampling frame is a physical list associated with a population. It should include everyone (everything) in the population, but that's an ideal that is often difficult to meet.

Because it is a physical list, you can draw a sample from it.

It costs a lot of money to compile a sampling frame, so if you have one, you should definitely take advantage of it.

As an example of a sampling frame, the U.S. Bureau of the Census maintains a database of every housing unit in the United States. It relies on the U.s. Postal Service and community based canvassing efforts to collect information for 278 million addresses in the United States.

I hope that any sampling frame that you develop isn't quite as big as this.

## What is a sample?

* A sample is a subset of a population
* Representativeness more important than size
+ Reasons for sampling
	+ Expense
	+ Time
	+ Quality control

::: notes

A sample is a subset of a population. It is usually smaller and easier to manage than the entire population.

Critically important in sampling is for the sample to be representative. That's even more important than the actual size of the sample.

College students are not representative of young adults. Volunteers in a clinical trial are not representative of everyone who has the disease.

The major reasons you sample are time and money. The population that id defined in most research studies is far too big for a complete enumeration. There are some exceptions, of course, but almost all studies have to work with a sample.

In fact, one definition of Statistics is the use of information from samples to make inferences about a population. That's a bit narrow perhaps, but still a pretty good starting point if anyone asks you what Statistics really is.

## Two major types of samples

* Random sample
  + Everyone has known non-zero probability
* Non-random sample
  + Different selection probabilities
  + Some may have zero selection probability

::: notes

A random sample is a sample where every individual (or every object) in the population has a known non-zero probabilitiy of being selected. In many random samples the probability of selection is the same for every subject, but not always.

A random sample is an ideal which is rarely met perfectly, but sometimes you can get pretty close to this ideal. A random sample requires a sampling frame that is a complete list within the population.

A non-random sample is a sample where the probability of selection varies. A few lucky people might have a higher probability of being selected than others. There may be others who have a lower selection probability. Maybe they are trying to hide from you. Maybe they have caller id and they try to screen their calls. Maybe they work odd hours and are difficult to track down.

For any sample, always ask yourself "Who was left out?" if certain people in your sample have a zero probability of being selected, think long and hard about what this means.

## Extreme example:  World War II bombers

![Image of bomber with indication of damage](../images/08/wainer bomber image.png)

::: notes

There was a statistician, Abraham Wald, who was asked to help out during World War II with a sampling problem. A lot of bombers were not returning from their missions, so the Royal Air Force wanted to put armor on the bombers. But where to put it? They couldn't put it everywhere because it would be too heavy to take off. Even a little bit of extra armor was troublesome because it would decrease the total wieght of bombs that they might carry.

So Dr. Wald looked at the planes that returned and noted where they had holes from enemy fire. These holes were distributed more or less randomly throughout the plane except for two regions where there was nothing. This image, which was taken from the 1998 Howard Wainer article that I mention in the recommended readings, shows where there was nothing: in the middle of the plane between the two wings and underneath the tail.

His recommendation was to place the armor only in those two areas. This seems counterintuitive, which is why it makes such a good puzzle. Dr. Wald hypothesized that any plane hit in those regions did not survive to return. The other areas could be hit and the plane could still limp back to safety. This is an example of selection bias. The bombers in the study were not a random sample of all bombers, they were a sample of bombers that returned safely.

## Example: in school survey of drug use in teenagers

* Who has lower selection probability?
* Who has a zero selection probability?
* Can you redefine your population?

::: notes

Suppose you are interested in a survey of teenagers in your community. You go to a high school and select a sample of students. Who has a lower selection probability? Students with a chronic illness, because they tend to miss a lot of days of school. Who has a zero selection probability? Home-schooled teenagers, for one, and dropouts for another.

Now is this a terrible thing? Students with a chronic illness probably have a different drug use pattern (both legal and illegal drugs) than most other studients. I'm not sure about home-schooled students, but students who have dropped out of high school almost certainly have a different drug use pattern.

But think about it from a high school principal's perspective. He or she might be interested only in drug use patterns among students who attend school, so the omission of home schooled students and dropouts may not be an issue.

What you should do, perhaps, is to redefine your population more narrowly when you recognize problems with differential selection probabilities.

## Example: prisoner IQ study

* Hypothetical study
  + Calculate average IQ of prisoners 
  + Lower than general public
* Conclude: criminals less intelligent than honest people(???)

::: notes

This is a silly example, perhaps, but consider a hypothetical study where you give IQ tests to a random sample of prisoners. You find that the average IQ in this group is lower than the average IQ in the general public.

That seems reasonable enough, but what conclusion can you draw? You might be tempted to conclude that criminals have a lower IQ than honest people.

Maybe, but keep in mind that you won't find every criminal in prison. A better conclusion might be that criminals who get caught are dumber than criminals who don't get caught.
