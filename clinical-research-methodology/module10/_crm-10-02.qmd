## `r section`, Questionnaire

-   Not the same as a survey
    -   Questionnaire is the form
    -   Survey is the process
-   Administration
    -   Mail
    -   Computer (REDCap)
    -   Telephone
    -   In person
  
::: notes

A questionnaire is a form with questions that your research subjects fill out by themselves. The term "questionnaire" is often used interchangeably with the word "survey," but there is a distinction. The questionnaire is a specific term referring to the form itself, while a survey is intended to describe the entire process of data collection.

Now I myself use these terms without regard to the semantics, so if you do so also, you are in good company. But once in a while you will find someone who insists on careful choices of words like this.

You can administer a questionnaire over the telephone or in person. If you wanted to get fussy about terminology, a telephone or in person questionnaire is actually an interview. This is like everything else. You'll find a fuss-budget who will insist on the proper terminology and they are correct to do so. But they are still fuss-budgets.

You can send out a questionnaire by mail or you can ask people to fill out the questionnaire on the computer. If you are using the computer, you should consider REDCap instead of commercial products like SurveyMonkey or SurveyGizmo. REDCap is an open source product that is supported by the Center for Health Insights. It's useful for any research project, but especially for online questionnaires.

The benefit of REDCap (and to be fair, these are benefits that commercial products like SurveyMonkey also share) is that it automates data entry for you. The data from your questionnaire populates a database with a rigid structure that helps assure good data quality.

REDCap will also do some basic spot checking for you and will prevent some problems with invalid entries. So, you won't see someone check two items on a list where you asked them to only check one. You won't get an entry of 3.5 when the only possible values are 1 through 5 plus 9.

## `r section`, Question types

-   No one to supervise if person answers "incorrectly".
    -   Q. What is your age? A. Older than dirt.
    -   Q. What is the one word that describes your greatest weakness? A. Inability to follow directions.
-   Three broad classes of questions
    -   Open ended
    -   Partial open ended
    -   Close ended

::: notes

Right off the bat, there is a big difference between interviews and questionnaires. The interviewer can play the role of a referee, of sorts. In an interview, if someone comes up with a response that is ambiguous or clearly out of bounds, the interviewer can step in (carefully, of course) and fix things. That's not an option for a paper and pencil questionnaire. A computerized questionnaire offers a partial fix - it will beep or buzz when you try something outside of a predetermined range. That's nice, but it is not nearly as flexible as an actual human being.

For both questionnaires and interviews, you have three broad class of questions: open ended questions, partial open ended questions and close ended questions.

## `r section`, Advantages of open ended questions

-   Richer, more detailed responses
-   Captures unanticipated responses
-   Avoids "pigeonholing".
    -   "Pigeonholing is a process that attempts to classify disparate entities into a limited number of categories (usually, mutually exclusive ones). The term usually carries connotations of criticism, implying that the classification scheme referred to inadequately reflects the entities being sorted, or that it is based on stereotypes." Wikipedia.
  
::: notes

Open ended questions let people use their own words. You can get an unlimited number of responses, which is both good and bad. The open ended question provides a richer set of responses, but is harder to quantify.

If you don't know the general categories of responses that people can provide in advance, the open ended question is your best friend. But keep in mind that you could use a pilot study with open ended questions to get a general idea of what the possible responses might be and use that to design close ended questions for the full study.

The other big advantage of open ended questions is that it avoids pigeon-holing. A pigeon hole is an array of stacked boxes that allow you to sort through paperwork quickly by placing different types of papers into different boxes. The term is often used pejoratively to refer to the process of assigning categories that often are too simplistic because of the limited number of choices.

## `r section`, Advantages of close ended questions

-   Faster
-   Easier to analyze
-   Better quality control

Note: partially open ended questions are a compromise and have the worst of both worlds.

::: notes

Close ended questions are faster, and that's a benefit both to you and to the person filling out the questionnaire. This is especially true if you are using mobile devices like phones and tablets to collect your data. The keyboard that is available on these devices is small and difficult to use. Your research subjects will probably be much happier if they can tap to select one from a limited set of options.

Close ended questions are easier to analyze. 

Quality control is a bit easier with close ended questions. That doesn't mean that someone won't trip you up. But less latitude in how you can respond means fewer things that could be done wrong.

## `r section`, Types of close ended questions

-   Fill in the blank
-   Ordinal scales
    -   Semantic differential scales
    -   Likert scale
    -   Visual analog scale
-   Nominal scales
    -   Select one option
    -   Select all that apply

::: notes

There are several possible ways to ask close ended questions.

You can ask people to fill in the blank. Strictly speaking this is not a close ended question, but the intent is to get responses from a limited subset. You might ask a person "What is your age?" and leave a blank and you're supposed to fill in a number.

In some cases, fill in the blank works just fine, but always watch out for unexpected responses.

For an ordinal response, the order of the choices has meaning. If you re-arranged the order of choices for an ordinal category, you would, at a minimum, make things confusing. So a common ordinal scale is strongly disagree, disagree, neutral, agree, strongly agree. it would mess things up if you tried to alphabetize these responses: agree, disagree, neutral, strongly agree, strongly disagree.

For a nominal response, the order is largely arbitrary. Suppose you had to choose between the marital status choices: single, married, divorced, widowed. Re-ordering these alphabetically (divorced, married, single, widowed) is a little weird, but still tolerable.

Ordinal responses typically are collected using a semantic differential scale, a visual analog scale or some type of Likert scale.

Nominal responses are collected using a check box, but there are two possibilities: check only one, or check all that apply.

## `r section`, Semantic differential scale

-   Pairs of polar opposite adjectives
-   Internal scale with no intermediate descriptors
-   Select a response along the continuum.
-   Common themes
    -   Evaluative (good-bad)
    -   Potency (strong-weak)
    -   Activity (fast-slow)

::: notes

The semantic differential scale has two extreme endpoints with unlabeled numbers in between. You are supposed to pick a number that represents how close you are to one of the two extremes. This if often done with moods (happy/sad, calm/excited, silly/serious), but you can also use this to evaluate something external like the quality of your interaction with a health care provider (rude/courteous, friendly/cold, informative/confusing).

There are three common themes for these pairs of polar opposites. They are usually measuring an evaluation (good versus bad, for example), or potency (strong versus weak), or activity (faster versus slow). This structure, has been studied extensively using various factor analysis models and is often referred to by the acronym EPA.

## `r section`, Example of a semantic differential scale

![Semantic differential scale with three items](images/semantic-differential.png "Scales ranging from 1 to 7 with descriptions at either extreme")

::: notes

Here's an example of a semantic differential scale that is found in the article by Desselle on summated rating attitude scales. The adjective pairs are inaccessible/totally accessible, rude/courteous, caring/unsympathetic. You get to choose a number between 1 and 7 where 1 represents completely rude and 7 represents completely courteous on the second question, for example.
