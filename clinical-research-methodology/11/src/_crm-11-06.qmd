## Spreadsheet software

-   Examples
    -   Microsoft Excel
    -   Macintosh Numbers
    -   Libre Office Calc
    -   Google Sheets
-   Not recommended

## If you enter data into Excel

-   Do not use colors
-   Do not include summary statistics
-   Rectangular grid
-   Don't squeeze two data values into one cell
    -   Systolic/diastolic blood pressures
    -   44M for a 44 year old male
-   Variable names in first row
-   No blank cells
    -   Contradicts your book

::: notes

A lot of researchers do their data entry in Microsoft Excel or some similar spreadsheet program. This is, at best, sub-optimal. REDCap is a much better option. But if you decide to use a spreadsheet, be careful. Spreadsheets are very flexible. Too flexible. You can put some of your numbers over here and others over there and then some more in the middle, and what you end up with is a muddle.

The key rule for a spreadsheet is to use a rectangular grid. A rectangular grid has a single number at the intersection of every row and column. Don't leave holes in your grid, even if the value is missing. 

Don't try to squeeze to pieces of data into the same cell. A common problem is when researchers put 120/80 into a cell to represent the systolic and diastolic blood pressures. When you enter data like this, you have two problems. First, there is no easy way to compute the average systolic or diastolic blood pressure. Second, some statistical software will see the slash and confuse it for division, converting your 120/80 into 1.5.

Use one cell for the systolic blood pressure and a different cell for the diastolic blood pressure. Likewise, an entry of 44M for a forty four year old male is troublesome. You can't easily compute the average age or the percentage of males.

It's a good idea to place the variable names in the first row of the spreadsheet. It's not a strict requirement, as you have already provided the variable names in your data dictionary. If you are nice enough to do this, however, it will be easier to import the data. the first row also makes it possibile to spot check your data to make sure that the columns are lining up properly.

Don't use the first two or three rows to organize your variables into headings and subheadings.

A lot of people will include some brief summary statistics as the last row or two of the spreadsheet. This is a bad idea, as the summary statistics might be confused for actual data points. If you need to compute a few summary statistics, learn how to place these in a separate worksheet.

Don't use a lot of fancy formatting in your spreadsheet. This means, no colors, no different fonts or sizes, and no merged cells. All of this is lost when you import your data into SAS, SPSS, or R.

Let me emphasize one more thing. Do not use blank cells ever in your spreadsheet. If your data is missing, use a missing value code. This contradicts your book's advice, but your book is wrong. A blank cell could easily be converted into a zero, if you're not careful and zero is quite different than missing.

If the structure of your data is irregular and cannot fit into a rectangular grid, re-organize. If you have measurements on 24 treatment subjects and 26 controls, don't put the outcome measure for the 24 treatment patients in one column and the 26 control patients in a second column. Put all 50 in a single column and add an additional column with 26 ones and 24 twos to distinguish who is a treatment patient and who is a control.

## A poorly structured spreadsheet

::: notes

This image and the next three might be a bit tricky to see on your screen. You can download the original images from the Canvas site and magnify them, if you want to see the details.

Here is a spreadsheet that I received recently that violates many of the recommendations that I just made.

The first row contains information that should belong in the data dictionary. The second and third rows organize the variables into major groupings: the Kear HTN Management Tool, and the Motivators of and Barriers to Health-Smart Behaviors Inventory. There are subgroups within these two groups: Medication Adherence, Health Behaviors, Medication Side Effects, and Barriers to Managing Blood Pressure for the Kear HTN Management Tool, and Healthy Breakfast - Motivators, and some other subgrous for the Motivators of and Barriers to Health-Smart Behaviors Inventory.

The groupings and subgroupings belong in the data dictionary but not here. 

The fourth column gives a description of each variable. The first two columns are: I forgot to take my medication for high blood pressure,	I took all my medication for high blood pressure. These are much too long to serve as variable names. They would make great variable labels instead, and this information belongs in a data dictionary.

There is an important bit of information hidden in the formatting of the variable labels.

"Any question from any survey that is in yellow text indicates that the "ideal response" would run on a spectrum opposite to the majority of other responses, e.g. most responses on the MBHBI are "ideally" 4 for a healthy individual, but for a question in yellow text, a healthy individual would indicate 1."

So the ninth column (I participate in activities to reduce or limit my stress to help lower my blood pressure) is in black because a large value is good. But the tenth column (I have experienced side effects from my high blood pressure medication (such a dizziness, unsteadiness, weakness, decreased heart rate, or fatigue)) is in yellow because a small value is good.

The sixth row is totally blank which is great for readability but an annoyance when you import the data.

Finally, notice the blank cells. I found out that these represented cases where someone skipped a question.

## Revisions to this spreadsheet

![](images/spreadsheet-data-02.png "A revised spreadsheet collapsing the first few rows and removing information that belongs in a data dictionary")

::: notes

I was able to work with this data set, as is, without too much trouble, but here's a modification that would have been a bit easier to work with.

The first row includes brief, but descriptive variable names. The column names are MedAdherence1 through 3, HealthBehaviors1	through 5, SideEffects1 through 3, and so forth. I anticipated that I would not need to distinguish among the particular questions within a subgroup, since I would probably just use an aggregate sum of each subgroup (after reverse scaling) for most of the analyses.

::: notes

I also cut and pasted some of the preliminary rows in the original spreadsheet and restructured things a bit to develop a data dictionary.
