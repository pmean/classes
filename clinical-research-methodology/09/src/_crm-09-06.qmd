The Neighborhood Environment Scale is a self report. You could get a researcher to drive through a neighborhood and assess its environment, but asking the residents themselves is faster, and possibly more accurate.

The pain scale is also a self report. If you are assessing pain in adults and children, you normally rely on self-reports. A researcher can assess pain in infants who are nonverbal by looking for facial expression, leg and arm movements, and other signs. In animals, it depends on the animal, but there are often clues in their appearance and behavior. Still, it is preferred to use self report for pain and you can get reliable measures from very young children.

::: notes

You cannot ask for a self report in a newborn infant. Actually, this newborn is offering a fairly strong assessment of his/her condition, but normally an outsider will assess how an infant is doing immediately after birth.

You also do not see self reports in assessing the bowel preparation, unless you are self-administering a colonoscopy. Definitely not recommended!

## Examples of composite scores

::: {.column}
![Apgar score](../images/apgar-image.jpg)
:::
::::::

::: notes

The neighborhood environment scale is a composite measurement because you ask 18 separate questions. The Apgar score is also a composite measurement because you rate the infant on five separate items.

## Examples of single measurements

![Boston Bowel Prep Score](../images/bbps-image.jpg)

::: notes

The pain score is a single measurement. You do not ask about five different types of pain and add them up. Likewise, the Boston Bowel Prep score is a single measurement.

## Examples of constructs

There could be some debate about this, but I would call the Apgar score a social construct. You are measuring distress associated with the birth process. Distress is an abstraction that you cannot measure directly. The Neighborhood Environment Survey is also measuring a rather abstract concept, the quality of your living environment. What you and I would consider to be a good environment is something that we construct. This is an exmaple of a social construct.

## Examples of biological or physical measurements

![Pain scale](../images/pain-image.jpg)

::: notes

The Boston Bowel Prep Score is a measure of a physical phenomenon, the visibility of the walls of your colon.

Pain is on the border, but I would call it a biological process rather than a psychological construct because it involves the transfer of information across your nervous system.

## Pop quiz

::: {.column}
-   Is the disgust score 
    -   a self report or a researcher evaluation?
    -   a composite measure or a single measurement?
    -   a psychological or social construct or a biological or physical measurement?

::: notes

I put in the disgust scale because it is the perfect example of a psychological construct. 

But is it a self report or a researcher evaluation?

Is is a composite measure or a single measurement?
