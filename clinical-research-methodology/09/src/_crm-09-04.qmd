This is the Neighborhood Environment Survey.

I realize this image might be difficult to read on your computer. I'm going to magnify this in a bit, but notice that this is a series of 18 true/false questions.

::: notes

Here are some of the questions on the NES. "There are plenty of safe places to walk or play outdoors in my neighborhood" and "Every few weeks, some kid in my neighborhood gets beat-up or mugged." These question are answered true/false and points of 0 or 1 are assigned. Notice that some of the questions get a 1 for true and some of the questions get a 1 for false. The total score is 0 to 18.

Pain is something that cannot be easily observed by an outsider. You are best off asking someone directly what their pain is like.

The image on the right shows the five components of the Apgar score. It was found at 

https://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/File:APGAR_score.jpg

and is published on an open source license.

This is the Apgar score. It is a measurement taken one minute after a person is born. There are five components to the Apgar score, each rated as zero, one, or two. Just a hint here. If you happen to be born, being blue, limp, and not crying is a very bad thing.

This baby is the opposite. Screaming its lungs out, thrashing all around, nice pink color.

The image on the left is a colonoscope. It was downloeaded from

On the right is the first page of a publication available through Pubmed Central. It is also available under an open source license.

This an except from an article establishing the reliability and validity of the Boston Bowel Prep score. When you get a colonoscopy done, you're supposed fast for a full day and also drink a foul tasting preparation. Almost a gallon of this stuff. When you're done, the next day, your bowel is cleaned out enough that the colonoscopist can go hunting for polyps in your colon.

An objective measure of how well you did with your fasting and with your drink preparation is the Boston Bowel Prep Score. This is an excerpt from the research article that established reliability and validity of this measure.

Lai EJ, Calderwood AH, Doros G, Fix OK, Jacobson BC. The Boston bowel preparation scale: a valid and reliable instrument for colonoscopy-oriented research. Gastrointest Endosc. 2009 Mar;69(3 Pt 2):620-5. doi: 10.1016/j.gie.2008.05.057. Epub 2009 Jan 10. PubMed PMID: 19136102; PubMed Central PMCID: PMC2763922.

## Case study #4 - Boston Bowel Prep Score

![Excerpt from Lai et al article](../images/bbps-magnified.png)

::: notes

Here's a careful look at the four values. 0 means that you can't see anything because of the presence of solid stool (somebody didn't fast like they should have!) and 3 means only small fragments of stool or opaque liquid. You don't want a zero because they'll make you do the colonoscopy all over again.

Here is a closer look at the first six items on this scale. Monkey meat? Mucus? Cockroaches? They are all pretty disgusting if you ask me. But some people keep cockroaches as pets.
