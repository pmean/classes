title: "MEDB 5510, Clinical Research Methodology, Module14 Videos"
---

Note that I am including some recordings done back in 2019. You do not need to watch these, and you probably do not want to watch them. I am putting them here because I want to eventually turn the content of these videos into a book about research methods. Students who attended the live lecture on Wednesday do not have to view either recording, unless they want to.

### 2021 recordings

#### V14-00, Talking about your research

+ First half in [Panopto format][v1401].
+ Second half in [Panopto format][v1402]
+ Slides and speaker notes available in [pdf format][g1401]
  + Note: this is a new talk not given in previous years. There was a computer crash during the recording, which is why this talk has two halves.
