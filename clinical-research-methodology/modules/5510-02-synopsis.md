Research must meet some very strict ethical standards. You need to think about this as you plan your research. There is no point proposing research that would not be approved by your Institutional Review Board. This module covers the historical events that helped shape how we perceive ethical conduct of research today.

Whistle blowing is a term describing an individual who reveals fraud (in our case, research fraud) in an organization. If you encounter work that you perceive to be research fraud, you have several avenues that you can pursue to report this fraud. This module will include discussion of actual cases of whistle blowing.

Start thinking about a research problem that you might want to develop a research plan for.  It could be what you anticipate you working on when you get to your capstone project, thesis, or dissertation. But if you don't know yet what you plan to work on, or if your degree program does not require a capstone, thesis, or dissertation, just pick a topic that think would be fun and interesting to explore. By the middle of the semester, I need you to produce a literature review associated with your research problem. By the end of the semester, I need you to produce an updated literature review, based on the feedback that you get plus a methods section. These two assignments will form the bulk of your grade. You will hear more about these assignments in the upcoming weeks.
