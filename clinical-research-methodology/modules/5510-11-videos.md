### Readings and Resources

+ Required reading
  + Chapter 8 of Gliner, Morgan, and Leech.

+ Recommended reading
  + See the recommended reading page on my github site.

Handouts are in draft form. I hope to finalize them by 2022-03-09 (Wednesday) at noon.

+ Handouts associated with videos
  + Video11. Data management. Slides and speaker notes available in [pdf format][git1]

### Videos

I plan to review the videos from last year and either re-use them or re-record them. You will get live links to these videos on or before 5pm on 2022-03-11 (Friday).

There are 5 videos with a total of about ? minutes.

+ Videos to be recorded
  + V11-01, Variable names and labels, missing value codes
  + V11-02, Dates, value labels, and reverse coding
  + V11-03, Multiple response, longitudinal/repeated measures
  + V11-04, Double entry coding, Excel files
  + V11-05, Text files, database files

For archival purposes, I am including a [page with links to video recordings][git0] done back in 2019, 2020, and 2021. You do not need to watch these, and you probably do not want to watch them. I am putting them here because I want to eventually turn the content of these videos into a book about research methods.

### Active Learning

There is

+ a discussion board,
+ a short quiz, and
+ a homework assignment

available on the Canvas website.
