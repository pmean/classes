#### Videos

I plan to review the videos from last year and either re-use them or re-record them. You will get live links to these videos on or before noon on 2022-01-20 (Thursday).

+ Videos not yet available.
  + Syllabus review.
  + Week by week review of topics.
  + What is clinical research?
  + Research dichotomies, part 1
  + Research dichotomies, part 2
  + Your homework

For archival purposes, I am including a [page with links to video recordings][git1] done back in 2019, 2020, and 2021. You do not need to watch these, and you probably do not want to watch them. I am putting them here because I want to eventually turn the content of these videos into a book about research methods.

#### Readings

+ Required reading
  + Chapter 1 of Gliner, Morgan, and Leech.
  + Conroy. Where do research ideas come from? Available in [html format](http://www.pmean.com/99/ideas.html).
