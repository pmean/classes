Observational studies are  used when the researcher does not control the intervention. The intervention is under the control of the patients and their health care providers.  Or the intervention is not under the control of anyone. In this case, the intervention is often called an exposure instead. There are strong advantages and disadvantages to the use of observational research. While it often takes more effort to manage and analyze observational data, it can still provide definitive conclusions.

Secondary data analysis, retrospective evaluation of data collected for other purposes, is a commonly encountered form of observational research. There are many sources of secondary data that allow you to quickly and inexpensively produce good research.
