+ Handouts associated with videos
  + Video03. Literature review. Slides and speaker notes available in [pdf format][git1]

### Videos

I plan to review the videos from last year and either re-use them or re-record them. You will get live links to these videos on or before 5pm on 2022-02-04 (Friday).

There are 6 videos with a total of 64 minutes.

+ Videos to be recorded
  + V03-01, What is a literature review available in [Panopto format][v0301] (13 minutes)
  + V03-02, Finding articles available in [Panopto format][v0302] (17 minutes)
  + V03-03, Analyzing articles available in [Panopto format][v0303] (10 minutes)
  + V03-04, Evaluating articles available in [Panopto format][v0304] (13 minutes)
  + V03-05, Organizing your literature review available in [Panopto format][v0305] (8 minutes)
  + V03-06, Reviewing your homework for this module available in [Panopto format][v0306] (3 minutes)

For archival purposes, I am including a [page with links to video recordings][git0] done back in 2019, 2020, and 2021. You do not need to watch these, and you probably do not want to watch them. I am putting them here because I want to eventually turn the content of these videos into a book about research methods.

### Active Learning

There is

+ a discussion board,
+ a short quiz, and
+ a homework assignment

available on the Canvas website.
