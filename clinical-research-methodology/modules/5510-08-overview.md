#### Sampling designs

#### Synopsis

Sampling is the process by which you select patients for your research study. You can use probability principles to generate your sample (probability sampling), which can help ensure representativeness. Some approaches to sampling do not control the probablity of selection (non-probability sampling).

#### Learning objectives

In this module, you will learn how to

+ describe different approaches to probability sampling
+ discuss advantages and disadvantages of non-probability samples


#### Readings and Resources

Handouts associated with the videos are draft only at this point. They will be finalized on or before noon on 2022-03-09 (Wednesday).

+ Required reading
  + Chapter 9 of Gliner, Morgan, and Leech.

+ Recommended reading
  + See the [recommended reading page][git2] on my github site.

+ Handouts associated with videos
  + Video08. Sampling. Slides and speaker notes available in [pdf format][git1]

#### Videos

I plan to review the videos from last year and either re-use them or re-record them. You will get live links to these videos on or before 5pm on 2022-03-11 (Friday).

There are 4 videos with a total of 77 minutes, with one more video to be added.

+ Videos
  + V08-01, Samples and populations, 19 minutes, available in [Panopto format][v0801]
  + V08-02, Probability samples, generating a random sample, 13 minutes, available in [Panopto format][v0802]
  + V08-03, Non-probability samples, how to randomize, 19 minutes, available in [Panopto format][v0803]
  + V08-04, Writing a methods section, 16 minutes, available in [Panopto format][v0804]
  + V08-05, Review of homework assignment, not yet available

For archival purposes, I am including a [page with links to video recordings][git0] done back in 2019, 2020, and 2021. You do not need to watch these, and you probably do not want to watch them. I am putting them here because I want to eventually turn the content of these videos into a book about research methods.

#### Active Learning

Links to the assignments will be finalized on or before noon on 2022-03-09 (Wednesday).

There is

+ a discussion board,
+ a short quiz, and
+ a homework assignment

available on the Canvas website.
