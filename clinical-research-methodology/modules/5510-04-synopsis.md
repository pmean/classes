Randomization is the use of a random device, like the toss of a coin or the roll of a die, or more frequently, a random number generator to see which patients are assigned to which treatment groups. Randomization is difficult to achieve, and impossible to achieve in some settings. When you can use randomization, however, it is very powerful, eliminating many potential biases in your study and allowing you to make strong probability statements about the data that you collect. You should know when to use randomization and when it is impractical or impossible to use.
