A literature review provides your reader with the context needed to understand your research. It reviews what is already known about your topic, gaps in the existing knowledge, and how your proposed work will fill some of those gaps. It is important to understand how a literature review contrasts with other summaries of the existing research (such as an annotated bibliography or a systematic overview). You also need to choose an organizational structure for your literature review.

You will have to submit a literature review in a few weeks, so please start working on it now. If you are having trouble getting started, please talk to me.
