#### Hypothesis testing

#### Synopsis

If your research involves hypothesis testing, you need a basic understanding of Type I and II errors, p-values, and confidence intervals. You should also be aware of a Bayesian alternative to the classical approach to hypothesis testing.

#### Learning objectives

In this module, you will learn how to

+ discuss the goal of data analysis and interpretation in research projects
+ discuss statistical power and how to determine it
+ describe what is needed in order to determine sample size for a research project

#### 2021 recordings

#### Readings and Resources

Handouts associated with the videos are draft only at this point. They will be finalized on or before noon on 2022-04-13 (Wednesday).

+ Required reading
  + Chapters 16, 17 of Gliner, Morgan, and Leech.

+ Recommended reading
  + See the [recommended reading page][git2] on my github site.

Handouts are in draft form. I hope to finalize them by 2022-03-09 (Wednesday) at noon.

+ Handouts associated with videos
  + Video12. Hypothesis testing. Slides and speaker notes available in [pdf format][git1]

#### Videos

I plan to review the videos from last year and either re-use them or re-record them. You will get live links to these videos on or before 5pm on 2022-04-15 (Friday).

There are 7 videos with a total of about 166 minutes.

+ Videos to be recorded
  + V12-01. What is hypothesis testing (about 20 minutes)
  + V12-02. Statistical hypotheses (about 29 minutes)
  + V12-03. P-values (about 24 minutes)
  + V12-04. Confidence intervals (about 18 minutes)
  + V12-05. Non-inferiority testing (about 22 minutes)
  + V12-06. Criticisms of hypothesis testing (about 39 minutes)
  + V12-07. The Bayesian approach (about 14 minutes)

For archival purposes, I am including a [page with links to video recordings][git0] done back in 2019, 2020, and 2021. You do not need to watch these, and you probably do not want to watch them. I am putting them here because I want to eventually turn the content of these videos into a book about research methods.

#### Active Learning

Handouts associated with the videos are draft only at this point. They will be finalized on or before noon on 2022-04-13 (Wednesday).

There is

+ a discussion board,
+ a short quiz, and
+ a homework assignment

available on the Canvas website.
