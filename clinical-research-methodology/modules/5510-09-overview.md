#### Validity and reliability

#### Synopsis

Establishing validity and reliability for your measurements can greatly improve the credibility of your work. Some measurements do not require establishment of validity and reliabity, and for the others, the methods depend largely on the type of measurement.

#### Learning objectives

In this module, you will learn how to

+ understand when test-retest reliability and interrater reliability can be used.
+ describe the process by which you can establish face and content validity.


#### Readings and Resources

Handouts associated with the videos are draft only at this point. They will be finalized on or before noon on 2022-03-16 (Wednesday).

+ Required reading
  + Chapter 8 of Gliner, Morgan, and Leech.

+ Recommended reading
  + See the [recommended reading page][git2] on my github site.

+ Handouts associated with videos
  + Video09. Validity and Reliability. Slides and speaker notes available in [pdf format][git1]

#### Videos

I plan to review the videos from last year and either re-use them or re-record them. You will get live links to these videos on or before 5pm on 2022-03-18 (Friday).

There are 11 videos with a total of about ? minutes.

+ Videos to be recorded

  + V09a-01, Measurement that warrant special attention. Available in Panopto format (? minutes).
  + V09a-02, Indirect measures of the reliability coefficient. Available in Panopto format (? minutes).
  + V09a-03, Measures of internal consistency. Available in Panopto format (? minutes).
  + V09a-04, Measurement validity. Available in Panopto format (? minutes).
  + V09a-05, Criterion validity, construct validity. Available in Panopto format (? minutes).
  + V09b-01, Five case studies. Available in Panopto format (? minutes).
  + V09b-02, Three dichotomies of measurement. Available in Panopto format (? minutes).
  + V09b-03, Measurement reliability. Available in Panopto format (? minutes).
  + V09b-04, Measurement validity. Available in Panopto format (? minutes).
  + V09b-05, Five case studies, revisited. Available in Panopto format (? minutes).
  + V09b-06, your homework. Available in Panopto format (? minutes).


For archival purposes, I am including a [page with links to video recordings][git0] done back in 2019, 2020, and 2021. You do not need to watch these, and you probably do not want to watch them. I am putting them here because I want to eventually turn the content of these videos into a book about research methods.

#### Active Learning

Links to the assignments will be finalized on or before noon on 2022-03-16 (Wednesday).

There is

+ a discussion board,
+ a short quiz, and
+ a homework assignment

available on the Canvas website.
