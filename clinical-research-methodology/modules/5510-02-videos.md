#### Readings and Resources

+ Required reading
  + Chapter 2, 3, 14 of Gliner, Morgan, and Leech.

+ Recommended reading
  + See the recommended reading page on my github site.

Handouts are in draft form. I hope to finalize them by 2022-01-26 (Wednesday) at noon.

The handout is finalized, though I reserve the right to make minor changes to fix typos.

+ Handouts associated with videos
  + Video02. Planning and ethics. Slides and speaker notes available in [pdf format][git1]

#### Videos

I plan to review the videos from last year and either re-use them or re-record them. You will get live links to these videos on or before 5pm on 2022-01-28 (Friday).

There are 5 videos with a total of 118 minutes.

+ Videos to be recorded
  + V02-01, Steps in a research project available in [Panopto format][v0201] (17 minutes)
  + V02-02, Choosing a good research problem available in [Panopto format][v0202] (25 minutes)
  + V02-03, Developing a research hypothesis available in [Panopto format][v0203] (25 minutes)
  + V02-04, Research ethics available in [Panopto format][v0204] (45 minutes)
  + V02-05, Homework for module02 available in [Panopto format][v0205] (6 minutes)

For archival purposes, I am including a [page with links to video recordings][git0] done back in 2019, 2020, and 2021. You do not need to watch these, and you probably do not want to watch them. I am putting them here because I want to eventually turn the content of these videos into a book about research methods.

#### Active Learning

There is

+ a discussion board,
+ a homework assignment, and
+ a short quiz

available on the Canvas website.
