#### Synopsis

Research must meet some very strict ethical standards. You need to think about this as you plan your research. There is no point proposing research that would not be approved by your Institutional Review Board. This module covers the historical events that helped shape how we perceive ethical conduct of research today.

Whistle blowing is a term describing an individual who reveals fraud (in our case, research fraud) in an organization. If you encounter work that you perceive to be research fraud, you have several avenues that you can pursue to report this fraud. This module will include discussion of actual cases of whistle blowing.

Start thinking about a research problem that you might want to develop a research plan for.  It could be what you anticipate you working on when you get to your capstone project, thesis, or dissertation. But if you don't know yet what you plan to work on, or if your degree program does not require a capstone, thesis, or dissertation, just pick a topic that think would be fun and interesting to explore. By the middle of the semester, I need you to produce a literature review associated with your research problem. By the end of the semester, I need you to produce an updated literature review, based on the feedback that you get plus a methods section. These two assignments will form the bulk of your grade. You will hear more about these assignments in the upcoming weeks.

#### Learning objectives

In this module, you will learn how to

+ describe the difficulties faces by whistleblowers
+ list the historical events that influenced the development of research ethics

#### Readings and Resources

+ Required reading
  + Chapter 2, 3, 14 of Gliner, Morgan, and Leech.

+ Recommended reading
  + See the recommended reading page on my github site.

Handouts are in draft form. I hope to finalize them by 2022-01-26 (Wednesday) at noon.

The handout is finalized, though I reserve the right to make minor changes to fix typos.

+ Handouts associated with videos
  + Video02. Planning and ethics. Slides and speaker notes available in [pdf format][git1]

#### Videos

I plan to review the videos from last year and either re-use them or re-record them. You will get live links to these videos on or before 5pm on 2022-01-28 (Friday).

There are 5 videos with a total of 118 minutes.

+ Videos to be recorded
  + V02-01, Steps in a research project available in [Panopto format][v0201] (17 minutes)
  + V02-02, Choosing a good research problem available in [Panopto format][v0202] (25 minutes)
  + V02-03, Developing a research hypothesis available in [Panopto format][v0203] (25 minutes)
  + V02-04, Research ethics available in [Panopto format][v0204] (45 minutes)
  + V02-05, Homework for module02 available in [Panopto format][v0205] (6 minutes)

For archival purposes, I am including a [page with links to video recordings][git0] done back in 2019, 2020, and 2021. You do not need to watch these, and you probably do not want to watch them. I am putting them here because I want to eventually turn the content of these videos into a book about research methods.

#### Active Learning

There is

+ a discussion board,
+ a homework assignment, and
+ a short quiz

available on the Canvas website.
