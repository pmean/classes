#### Data management

#### Synopsis

Data management is often tedious and time-consuming, but it is vital for assuring good quality data for your analyses.

#### Learning objectives

In this module, you will learn how to

+ understand the value of a data dictionary.
+ identify how best to store dates and missing value codes.
+ describe the strengths and weaknesses of storing data in a spreadsheet.

#### Readings and Resources

Handouts associated with the videos are draft only at this point. They will be finalized on or before noon on 2022-04-06 (Wednesday).

+ Required reading
  + Chapters 13, 15 of Gliner, Morgan, and Leech.

+ Recommended reading
  + See the [recommended reading page][git2] on my github site.

+ Handouts associated with videos
  + Video11. Data management. Slides and speaker notes available in [pdf format][git1]

#### Videos

I plan to review the videos from last year and either re-use them or re-record them. You will get live links to these videos on or before 5pm on 2022-04-08 (Friday).

There are 6 videos with a total of about 94? minutes.

+ Videos to be recorded
  + V11-01, Variable names and labels, missing value codes, 18 minutes, available in [Panopto format][2022-1101]
  + V11-02, Dates, value labels, and reverse coding, 29 minutes, available in [Panopto format][2022-1102]
  + V11-03, Multiple response, longitudinal/repeated measures, 22 minutes, available in [Panopto format][2022-1103]
  + V11-04, Double entry coding, Excel files, 9 minutes, available in [Panopto format][2022-1104]

  + V11-05, Recommended readings, assignments, 5 minutes, available in [Panopto format][2022-1106]

For archival purposes, I am including a [page with links to video recordings][git0] done back in 2019, 2020, and 2021. You do not need to watch these, and you probably do not want to watch them. I am putting them here because I want to eventually turn the content of these videos into a book about research methods.

#### Active Learning

Handouts associated with the videos are draft only at this point. They will be finalized on or before noon on 2022-04-06 (Wednesday).

There is

+ a discussion board

available on the Canvas website.
