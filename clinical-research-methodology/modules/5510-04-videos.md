### Readings and Resources

Handouts associated with the videos are draft only at this point. They will be finalized on or before noon on 2022-02-09 (Wednesday).

+ Required reading
  + Chapter 5 of Gliner, Morgan, and Leech.

+ Recommended reading
  + See the [recommended reading page][git2] on my github site.

+ Handouts associated with videos
  + Video04. Randomization. Slides and speaker notes available in [pdf format][git1]

### Videos

I plan to review the videos from last year and either re-use them or re-record them. You will get live links to these videos on or before 5pm on 2022-02-11 (Friday).

There are 6 videos with a total of about 92 minutes.

+ Videos to be recorded
  + V04-01, Definition of experimental studies
  + V04-02, How and why to randomize
  + V04-03, Advantages and disadvantages of randomization
  + V04-04, Blinding
  + V04-05, Intention to treat analysis, baseline measurements
  + V04-06, Review of homework

For archival purposes, I am including a [page with links to video recordings][git0] done back in 2019, 2020, and 2021. You do not need to watch these, and you probably do not want to watch them. I am putting them here because I want to eventually turn the content of these videos into a book about research methods.

### Active Learning

Links to the assignments will be finalized on or before noon on 2022-02-09 (Wednesday).

There is

+ a discussion board,
+ a short quiz, and
+ a homework assignment

available on the Canvas website.
