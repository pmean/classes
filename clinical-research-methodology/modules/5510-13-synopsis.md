You must define your statistical analysis approach in your research plan. This module will cover the conceptual ideas behind a variety of statistical models (linear regression, logistic regression, survival analysis) not to the level of detail that you will need to know to conduct those analyses, but rather how to defend and justify these approaches in your methods section.
