### Videos

I plan to review the videos from last year and either re-use them or re-record them. You will get live links to these videos on or before 5pm on 2022-03-11 (Friday).

There are 4 videos with a total of 77 minutes, with one more video to be added.

+ Videos to be recorded
  + V08-01, Samples and populations, 19 minutes, available in [Panopto format][v0801]
  + V08-02, Probability samples, generating a random sample, 13 minutes, available in [Panopto format][v0802]
  + V08-03, Non-probability samples, how to randomize, 19 minutes, available in [Panopto format][v0803]
  + V08-04, Writing a methods section, 16 minutes, available in [Panopto format][v0804]
  + V08-05, Review of homework assignment, not yet available

For archival purposes, I am including a [page with links to video recordings][git0] done back in 2019, 2020, and 2021. You do not need to watch these, and you probably do not want to watch them. I am putting them here because I want to eventually turn the content of these videos into a book about research methods.

### Active Learning

Links to the assignments will be finalized on or before noon on 2022-03-09 (Wednesday).

There is

+ a discussion board,
+ a short quiz, and
+ a homework assignment

available on the Canvas website.
