### Readings and Resources

Handouts associated with the videos are draft only at this point. They will be finalized on or before noon on 2022-03-09 (Wednesday).

+ Required reading
  + Chapter 9 of Gliner, Morgan, and Leech.

+ Recommended reading
  + See the [recommended reading page][git2] on my github site.

+ Handouts associated with videos
  + Video08. Sampling. Slides and speaker notes available in [pdf format][git1]

### Videos

I plan to review the videos from last year and either re-use them or re-record them. You will get live links to these videos on or before 5pm on 2022-03-11 (Friday).

There are 4 videos with a total of about 78 minutes.

+ Videos to be recorded
  + V08-01, Samples and populations (about 22 minutes)
  + V08-02, Probability samples, generating a random sample (about 23 minutes)
  + V08-03, Non-probability samples, how to randomize (about 29 minutes)
  + V08-04, Review of homework assignment (about 4 minutes)

For archival purposes, I am including a [page with links to video recordings][git0] done back in 2019, 2020, and 2021. You do not need to watch these, and you probably do not want to watch them. I am putting them here because I want to eventually turn the content of these videos into a book about research methods.

### Active Learning

Links to the assignments will be finalized on or before noon on 2022-03-09 (Wednesday).

There is

+ a discussion board,
+ a short quiz, and
+ a homework assignment

available on the Canvas website.
