#### Getting started in research

#### Synopsis

How do you get started in research? First, you have to choose a problem to study. This is sometimes easy, but sometimes not so easy. This module will help you think about how to identify a research topic. It will also outline some of the fundamental choices that you will need to make as you work on your research problem. Do you want to do theoretical or applied research? Laboratory or field research? Qualitative or quantitative research? Inductive or deductive research? You should become familiar with all of these aspects of research so you can thoughtfully select the approach that makes the most sense for your topic.

Throughout this class, you will be asked to produce writing related to a research topic of your own choosing. Ideally, you should select a topic that you will go on to address in your thesis (or capstone project). If you are in a track that does not require a thesis, that's okay. Just select something that relates to your long-term career goals. If you do not know what you want to do yet for your thesis, that's okay also. Just pick something that you think MIGHT relate to your eventual thesis As the class progresses, you may decide to modify your topic or abandon it for a completely different topic. That's okay also. Some students, especially students with a more mathematical background, may find it difficult to select a good research topic. I would be glad to meet with anyone and brainstorm some ideas.

#### Learning objectives

In this module, you will learn how to

+ Define "clinical research methodology"
+ Select an appropriate research topic
+ Distinguish between various research approaches

#### Videos

I plan to review the videos from last year and either re-use them or re-record them. You will get live links to these videos on or before 5pm on 2022-01-21 (Friday).

I am listening to the videos I recorded in 2022 and they are quite good. I doubt that I could do as well in 2023, but I will judge this for future modules. Some of the videos may need to be re-recorded. I will post the links to either the new or old videos by each Wednesday of the semester.

A few issues have changed from 2022.

+ The syllabus on Canvas for the 2023 course is final, not provisional as it was in 2022.
+ No one signed up for the in-class, synchronous option. So everyone will be taking the course asynchronously. That means that you listen to lectures on video at your own time and place. 
+ I am now openly encouraging face-to-face meetings, but Zoom is often a more convenient option as it avoids travel time. Choose whatever suits you best. 
+ There are a few "gaffes" like in one of the videos where I forget for almost three minutes to advance to the proper Powerpoint slide. Oops! I would probably have a different gaffe if I re-recorded.
+ I discuss the content of the thirteen modules in one of the videos. I may add a fourteenth module. It would be short and not add a lot of extra assignments. I don't have the fourteenth module ready yet and may not get it done this semester. I also might add a bit of extra content of some of the thirteen modules, but only a very little bit.

In general, the content of the 2022 videos for module01 are very good. Enjoy!

There are 12 videos with a total of 107 minutes.

+ Videos
  + V00-01. Syllabus review. Available in [Panopto format][v0001] (4 minutes).
  + V01-01, Definition of research. Available in [Panopto format][v0101] (14 minutes)

For archival purposes, I am including a [page with links to video recordings][git0] done back in 2019, 2020, and 2021. You do not need to watch these, and you probably do not want to watch them. I am putting them here because I want to eventually turn the content of these videos into a book about research methods.

#### Active Learning

There is

+ a discussion board,
+ a homework assignment, and
+ a short quiz

available on the Canvas website.

#### Hw01. Create a title page for your project

Graded: 6 points, one point deducted if submitted late.

Select a research project that you might be interested in working on and give it a title. Don't worry too much about the content of the project at this point in time. Just pick something that you are familiar and comfortable with.

Find the document "Guide to Formatting Theses and Dissertations" on the UMKC website and review the requirements. Create a title page for your project. Please follow the thesis guidelines to the letter. On a second page, include a one of the following two sentences:

+ "I do give permission for my teacher to use an anonymized version of this assignment as an example for future classes" or 
+ "I do not give permission for my teacher to use an anonymized version of this assignment as an example for future classes"

Your grade will not be influenced by whether you give permission or not.

Convert your document to PDF format and submit it on Canvas.

Grading rubric:

+ Margins and spacing
  + Unsatisfactory (0 points) No serious attempt made to use required margins and spacing.
  + Marginal (1 point) Major deviations from the required margins and spacing.
  + Satisfactory (2 points) Only one or two minor departures from required margins and spacing.
  + Outstanding (3 points) No deviations from the required margins and spacing.

+ Fonts and capitalization
  + Unsatisfactory (0 points) No serious attempt made to use the required fonts and capitalization.
  + Marginal (1 point) Major deviations from the required fonts and capitalization.
  + Satisfactory (2 points) Only one or two minor departures the required fonts and capitalization.
  + Outstanding (3 points) No deviations from the required fonts and capitalization.

Note that you will not be graded on the content, just on the formatting (margins, spacing, fonts, and capitalization).

Submit your work [here]()

#### Discuss01. Introduce yourself

Graded: 3 points, one point deduction if submitted after the deadline.

Tell us about yourself. What degree program you are in, why you are taking this class, and what you are hoping to do when you graduate.

Optionally, include a picture of yourself and tell us about one of your hobbies.

Submit your comments [here]().

#### Quiz01

Graded: 10 points, one point deducted if submitted late.

Unless otherwise specified, all questions are True/False.

+ I am expected to participate in discussion as part of this class.
Group of answer choices

+ It does not matter what kind of email address I use to communicate with the instructor in this course.

+ I can still earn points for assignments that are turned in late.

+ My name should be part of the file name for anything that I send to Dr. Simon.

+ The two major projects are writing a literature review and a methods section for a research topic that I choose.

+ The required textbook for this class is:
  + Gliner, Morgan, and Leech
  + Sim and Wright
  + Hulley et al.
  + Portney and Watkins
  
+ I will not need to use Canvas for this course.

+ It's okay to disagree with someone else on the discussion board, as long as you critique the ideas rather than the person, and you are respectful and constructive.

+ It is okay to wait until the last week of the semester and then submit all of my work.

+ I have read and understood the information contained in the syllabus.
