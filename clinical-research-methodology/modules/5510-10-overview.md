#### Data collection

#### Synopsis

There are many approaches to collecting data. Some of these approaches (focus groups, interviews, questionnaires, in particular) require great care. This module illustrates some of the details that you need to specify in your data collection process.

#### Learning objectives

In this module, you will learn how to

+ describe the resources needed to conduct focus groups or a series of interviews.
+ develop strategies for putting together a questionnaire.
+ recognize the special issues associated with secondary data sources.


#### Readings and Resources

Handouts associated with the videos are draft only at this point. They will be finalized on or before noon on 2022-03-23 (Wednesday).

+ Required reading
  + Chapters 13, 15 of Gliner, Morgan, and Leech.

+ Recommended reading
  + See the [recommended reading page][git2] on my github site.

Handouts are in draft form. I hope to finalize them by 2022-03-09 (Wednesday) at noon.

+ Handouts associated with videos
  + Video09. Validity and Reliability. Slides and speaker notes available in [pdf format][git1]

#### Videos

I plan to review the videos from last year and either re-use them or re-record them. You will get live links to these videos on or before 5pm on 2022-03-25 (Friday).

There are 6 videos with a total of about ? minutes.

+ Videos to be recorded
  + V10-01, Focus groups available in Panopto format (? minutes).
  + V10-02, Interviews available in Panopto format (? minutes).
  + V10-03, Questionnaires available in Panopto format (? minutes).
  + V10-04, Likert scales available in Panopto format (? minutes).
  + V10-05, Nominal scales available in Panopto format (? minutes).
  + V10-06, Homework available in Panopto format (? minutes).

For archival purposes, I am including a [page with links to video recordings][git0] done back in 2019, 2020, and 2021. You do not need to watch these, and you probably do not want to watch them. I am putting them here because I want to eventually turn the content of these videos into a book about research methods.

#### Active Learning

Links to the assignments will be finalized on or before noon on 2022-02-02 (Wednesday).

There is

+ a discussion board,
+ a short quiz, and
+ a homework assignment

available on the Canvas website.
