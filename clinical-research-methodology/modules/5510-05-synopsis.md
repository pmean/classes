Quasi-experimental designs are used in settings where you have control over the intervention being offered, but you choose to forgo randomization. You use these designs often when randomization is impractical or unacceptable. These designs are frequently used in quality improvement studies. While there are legitimate concerns about weaknesses associated with quasi-experimental designs, you can still use them to  draw valid inferences.
