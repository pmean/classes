## Topics to be covered

```{r}
# Preliminaries, if needed

# Keep this chunk, even if no code, so that
# params is populated from the yaml header.

# To print speaker notes, add
#   ?print-pdf&showNotes=separate-page 
#   to the end of the URL. Then open the
#   print dialog box (ctrl-P) and choose
#   Save as PDF for the printer. Other 
#   options, like Microsoft Print to PDF
#   do not seem to work.
