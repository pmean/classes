## Analysis of Qualitative Data 

-   Qualitative â€“ 5 main approaches
	+ Phenomenology
	+ Grounded theory
	+ Ethnography
	+ Case study
	+ Narrative
-   Relies on a constructivist philosophy
    -   Rejection of the single reality of positivism
    -   Research protocol adapts as new information emerges

::: notes

Even if you never run a qualitative research study, you need to get an appreciation for how these studies are designed. They complement quantitative studies well and answer questions that would be difficult or impossible to answer with quantitative methods.

These approaches are all inductive (using specific findings to develop broader theories). You are trying to develop a framework of understanding. Don't go in with a heavy set of expectations.

Qualitative research relies heavily on a construcivist philosophy. This philosophy is a rejection of positivism, the belief that there is a an objective truth and that there is an objective method to get at this truth. The research methodology is adaptive. How you collect information changes all along the way. 

This sounds subjective, but the constructivist argues that you become more objective when you put aside your pre-conceived notions and assumptions.

I hope to talk more about this in week 12.

## Qualitative research: phenomenology (1 of 3)

-   Phenomenom: "an observable fact or event" (Merriam-Webster)
	+ What meaning do people place on this fact or event?
	+ How do people construct their own reality around certain events

::: notes

One definition of "phenomenon" is something the you observe. You want to find how different people place their own meanning on this fact or event. 

You have to try to understand from the perspective of the individual.

In the constructivist philosophy, there is no single reality, but rather you construct your reality based on social relationships and interactions. Your goal as a phenomenological researcher is to put aside your construction of reality and try to understand how others construct their reality.

## Qualitative research: phenomenology (2 of 3)

::: notes

Here's an example of a study using the phenomenological approach. In the methods section, the authors state that "The data were analyzed by using a five-step phenomenological analysis, which enables the researcher to enter the world of the participants and gain insight into their thoughts, feelings, and preferences."

## Qualitative research: phenomenology (3 of 3)

![Image of Pallesen 2019 abstract](images/pallesen19a.png)

::: notes

The phenomenological approach was used to answer three questions:

"(1) How do patients handle and overcome experienced changes after stroke? (2) How do they experience the support to handle these changes during the first year after stroke? (3) How do the similarities and differences transpire in Danish and Norwegian contexts?"

The researchers identified four main issues.

"The participants described four main issues in the recovery process that impacted the experienced changes: (i) strategies and personal factors that promote motivation, (ii) the involvement of family, social network, and peers, (iii) professionals' support, and (iv) social structures that limit the recovery process."
