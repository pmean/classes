## Qualitative research: grounded theory (1 of 3)

-   Generate theory from data collected from participants
	+ Inferences firmly "grounded" in the data
	+ Prior theoretical expectations avoided
	+ Sampling proceeds parallel to data collection & analysis
	+ Research maintains skepticism, seeks disconfirming examples

::: notes

Grounded theory is the development of a new theory through the personal experiences of individuals. These experiences are primary: your theory is grounded in the data you collect and you need to put aside an existing theoretical beliefs. The sampling process is conditional, and as you collect more data on personal experiences, you may wish to explore different perspectives from a different group. You need to be skeptical and look actively for information that may disconfirm what you think you have already discovered.

Here's an example of a study using the grounded theory approach.

## Qualitative research: grounded theory (3 of 3)

::: notes

The study was conducted because... "A significant number of women experience childbirth as traumatic. These experiences are often characterized by a loss of control coupled with a perceived lack of support and inadequate communication with health care providers. Little is known about the choices women make in subsequent pregnancy(s) and birth(s), or why they make these choices. This study aimed to understand these choices and explore the reasons behind them."

The general conclusion was that ... "If women who have previously experienced a traumatic birth become pregnant again, they have a strong desire to avoid a repeat experience and to feel in control of their birth choices."
