## What is ethnography?

-   Study of individuals who share the same culture
    -   Methods developed in Sociology/Anthropology
    -   Strong emphasis on observation

::: notes

Ethnography is the study of a group of people who share the same culture. The core ideas for ethnography were developed in Sociology and Anthropology, though its use has expanded into many different aspects of health care. Many of the resources that I reviewed stressed the importance of observation rather than interviewing, though both are used.

The study was conducted ... "to explore how womenâ€™s sexual behavior can become risky in the context of substance use."

The researchers discovered  ... "Three major themes ...  1) life in the context of drug abuse, 2) negative self-perception, and 3) strive to survive. Subthemes were identified as loss of contact with family, social stigma, self-forgetfulness, worthlessness, low self-efficacy, and unsafe sexual context."
