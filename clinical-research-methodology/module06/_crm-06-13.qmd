## Qualitative research: the case study (1 of 3)

-   In depth examination of a case or series of cases
    -   Not the same as a case report
    -   Viewed from a variety of lenses
-   Narrow definition
-   Emphasis on unusualness

::: notes

The case study is an in-depth examination of a case. It is not clear, to me anyway, what the difference is between a case and a phenomenon. The case could represent a single case, meaning the experiences of one person in a particular setting, or it could represent a series of people. The resources in this area stress the importance of examining the case from a variety of different perspectives.

The case study is not the same as a case report. The case report typically uses a factual reporting (mostly quantitative) of an unusual occurence for a single patient.

It is important to define the case narrowly with respect to time, location, demographics, or other factors.

The case study tries to identify the unusual or the outlier rather than the typical or average.

::: notes

The study was conducted to ... "investigate how contextual factors influenced care coordination for chronic mental illness care within the eThekwini District." 

The general conclusion was that ... "Inequitably resourced catchment areas, unclear referral systems, high staff turnover, freezing of posts, chronic staff shortage and adverse working conditions contributed to care fragmentation, poor client care and client loss in the system. On the other hand, limited community support systems constituted barriers for client reintegration into society and relapses."
