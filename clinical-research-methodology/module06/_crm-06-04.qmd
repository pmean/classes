## Research Approaches 

![](images/image-06-01.png)

::: notes

Going back to the figure that we have used, there are five columns. The past couple of weeks have talked about the first two columns. Now we will talk about the other three columns: comparative, associational, and descriptive studies.

For all of these studies, according to your book, you are "stuck" with an attribute independent variable, one that you cannot manipulate or control. It's one distinction, but you need to be careful because sometimes you have an active independent variable, one that you can control through randomization, but you choose not to randomize. We talked about these under the umbrella of quasi-experimental designs last week, but I want to talk more about them this week as well.

## Why not randomize everything?

-   Can't randomize because...
    -   Impossible
    -   Impractical
    -   Unethical
    -   Strong patient preference
    -   Retrospective studies
  
::: notes

If you have an attribute independent variable, as your book points out, you cannot randomize. When you compare demographic groups, those who belong to one demographic group are stuck in that group. You can change a person's race or gender at all, and changing a person's age group requires a time machine. You could, possibly, change a person's socio-economic status, as the film "Trading Places" illustrates, but this requires far too much effort to be done on a large scale.

Last week, we talked about setting where randomization was impractical. In a busy setting like an emergency room, you usually can't impose the complexities associated with randomization.

You can't randomize when you are studying a harmful exposure. It is unethical to deliberately expose someone to something that might hurt them. There are a few limited exceptions, such as a harm that is minor and easily reversible.

You can't randomize when patients and/or the treating physicians have a strong preference for (or against) a particular treatment. I talked last time about laproscopic surgery and how it was hard to convince patients to be randomly assigned to the alternative: open surgery, which leaves a large scar.

Finally, you can't randomize a retrospective study, since the data has already been collected.

Your book uses three categories for research: could randomize and did randomize; could randomize, but didn't (and sneers at this choice); and couldn't randomize (because you were "stuck" with an attribute random variable). I think it is better to think about the non-randomized studies using the five criteria listed above.

Of course, a non-randomized study could decide against randomization for more than one of the above reasons. Suppose you are studying the effect of second-hand smoke exposure. You couldn't randomly marry off half of your participants to smokers and half to non-smokers. It would be impractical, because you have to wait for several decades for the cancer to develop. It is unethical because you are deliberately exposing someone to something that is potentially harmful. You also have to deal with strong patient preference. Most of us are quite fussy about who we agree to marry.

## Departures from Gliner et al

-   "Observational" instead of "non-experimental"
-   Categorize by sample selection
    -   Cohort
    -   Cross-sectional
    -   Case-control
    -   Historical control

::: notes

I'm going to depart a bit from what your book says. The first departure is that I will use the term "observational" instead of "non-experimental." This is a bit dangerous, perhaps, because the term "observational" sometimes refers to research that involves watching what happens in public spaces. But in Medicine, at least, most people understand what I am talking about.

A bigger departure is that I want to classify non-experimental or observational studies not be how they were analyzed (comparative, associational, and descriptive) but by how the sample was selected. There are four approaches: cohort designs, cross-sectional designs, case-control designs, and historial control designs.

## What is a cohort design?

-   Cohort defined by exposure
-   Compared to unexposed controls
-   Prospective or retrospective

::: notes

The first type of observational design is called a cohort design. You select a group of people who have a specific exposure. You compare them to another group that does not have the exposure.

Cohort designs can be defined prospectively or retrospectively. But in a retrospective study, be sure that the outcome occurs after the exposure and not before the exposure.

## Disadvantages of cohort designs

-   Disadvantages
    -   Difficult for rare diseases, long latency
    -   Selection bias, confounding
-   Advantages
    -   Can examine multiple outcomes
    -   Easy to explain
    -   Well defined comparison group
    -   Adaptable to longitudinal analysis
  
::: notes

Let's talk about the disadvantages first.

If you are examining a rare outcome, you need a pretty large sample size. The rule of thumb is that you would like to see 25 to 50 events in the exposed and unexposed groups. If an outcome occurs rarely, like 0.1% of the time, then you'd need tens of thousands of patients to accumulate a sufficient number of events.

If you are looking at an outcome that has a long latency period (such as cancer), you might need to follow your patients for several decades. Who has that sort of luxury? A retrospective cohort might work here, but you'd better have a database that includes information across a very broad time span.

In a study where the patients and/or the doctors choose who gets what, you have an issue with selection bias. Also, you have no ability to insure covariate balance between the exposed and unexposed groups, so confounding is a serious issue.

## Advantages of cohort designs

-   Advantages
    -   Can examine multiple outcomes
    -   Easy to explain
    -   Well defined comparison group
    -   Adaptable to longitudinal analysis
  
::: notes

The cohort design can examine a variety of outcomes: mild, moderate, and severe.

It is usually pretty easy to present the data in a cohort design. You have two groups and you follow them over time and then see what happens to them.

It is usually (but not always) easy to define and collect data on a control group. The cohort design makes it easy to collect data at multiple time points (e.g., a longitudinal design) to evaluate short and long term effects of an exposure.
