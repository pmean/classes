## United States Bureau of the Census

![](images/census.png "Image of web site main page") 

::: notes

Question for the audience, when you think of Census Bureau, what is the first thing that springs to your mind? 

The Census Bureau is a federal agency that produces big data that is of direct value and which also provides the foundation for analyses of other big data sources. They also produce information critical for geographic information systems in the United States.

## Article I, Section II of the U.S. Constitution

![](images/constitution.png "Original copy of U.S. Constitution") 

::: notes

The Census Bureau is mandated by Article I, Section II of the U.S. Constitution to enumerate the population of the United States to allow the proper allocation of members of the House of Representatives to each state. This census was first held in 1790 and then every ten years afterwards. Full data from the census is released 72 years after the census was held. With careful linking across multiple censuses, researchers can track individuals such as Civil War veterans (Costa 2017) across their full lifespan, or measure demographic changes in narrowly defined geographic regions, such as marriage rates during the boll weevil epidemic of the early 1900s (Bloome 2017).

## Integrated Public Use Microdata Series International Partnership

::: notes

For more recent censuses, samples of microdata are available, though with steps taken to protect confidentiality (Dreschler 2012). Information from these sources as well as census microdata from 79 other countries is available in a standardized format through the Integrated Public Use Microdata Series International Partnership (Ruggles 2015).

## American Community Survey

![](images/acs.png "Image of web site main page") 

::: notes

Starting in 1940, the Census Bureau asked additional questions for a subsample of the census. The questions, known informally as “the long form,” had questions about income, occupation, education, and other socioeconomic issues. In 2006, the long form was replaced with the American Community Survey (ACS), which covered similar issues, but which was run continuously rather than once every ten years (Torrieri 2007). The ACS has advantages associated with the timeliness of the data, but some precision was lost compared to the long form (Spielman 2014, Macdonald 2006).

## Master Address File

![](images/maf.png "Master Address File web site") 

::: notes

Both the decennial census and the ACS rely on the Master Address File (MAF), a list of all the addresses in the United States where people might live. The MAF is maintained and updated by the Census Bureau from a variety of sources, but predominantly the delivery sequence file of the United States Postal Service (Loudermilk 2009).

:::

## Census blocks

![](images/census-blocks.png "Census block documentation page") 

::: notes

The census block, the smallest of these regions, typically represent what would normally be considered a city block in an urban setting, though the size might be larger for suburban and rural settings. There are many census blocks with zero reported population, largely because the areas are uninhabitable or because residence is prohibited (Freeman 2017).

## Topologically Integrated Geographic Encoding and Referencing System

![](images/tiger.png "TIGER documentation page") 

::: notes

The geographic aggregation is possible because of another product that is of great value to big data applications, the Topologically Integrated Geographic Encoding and Referencing (TIGER) System (Marx 1990). The TIGER System, a database of land features like roads and rivers and administrative boundaries like county and state lines and has formed the foundation of many commercial mapping products used in big data analysis (Croner 1996). The TIGER system allows many useful characterizations of geographic regions, such as whether a region contains a highway ramp, a marker of poor neighborhood quality, (Friesthler 2016) and whether a daycare center is near a busy road (Houston 2006).

## American Housing Survey

![](images/ahs.png "Image of web site main page") 

::: notes

The American Housing Survey (AHS) is a joint effort with the Department of Housing and Urban Development that surveys both occupied and vacant housing units in a nationally representative sample and a separate survey of large MSAs. The AHS conducts computer assisted interviews of roughly 47,000 housing units biennially. The AHS allows researchers to see whether mixed use development influences commuting choices (Cervero 1996) and to assess measures of the house itself (such as peeling paint) and the neighborhood (such as nearby abandoned buildings) that can correlated with health outcomes (Jacobs 2009).

## Current Population Survey

![](images/cps.png "Image of web site main page") 

::: notes

The Current Population Survey, a joint effort with the Bureau of Labor Statistics, is a monthly survey of 60,000 people that provides unemployment rates for the United States as a whole and for local regions and specific demographic groups. The survey includes supplements that allows for the analysis of tobacco use (Zhu 2017), poverty (Pac 2017), food security (Jernigan 2017), and health insurance coverage (Pascale 2016).

:::

## Consumer Expenditure Survey

![](images/ces.png "Image of web site main page") 

::: notes

The Consumer Expenditure Survey, also a joint effort with the Bureau of Labor Statistics, is an interview survey of major expenditure components combined with a diary study of detailed individual purchases that is integrated to provide a record of all expenditures of a family. The purchasing patterns for the basis for the market basket of goods used in computation of a measure of inflation, the Consumer Price Index. Individual level data from this survey allows for detailed analysis of purchasing habits, such as expenditures in tobacco consuming households (Rogers 2017) and food expenditures of different ethnic groups (Ryabov 2016).

## National Crime Victimization Survey

![](images/ncvs.png "Image of NCVS web site main page") 

::: notes

The National Crime Victimization Survey, a joint effort with the Bureau of Justice Statistics, is a self-report survey of 160,000 households per year on nonfatal personal crimes and household property crimes. The survey has supplements for school violence (Musu-Gillette 2016) and stalking (Menard 2016).
