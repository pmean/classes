## Break #5

-   What have you learned?
    -   Case-control designs
-   What's next?
    -   Cross-sectional designs

## Cross-sectional designs (1 of 3)

-   Single group
    -   No selection by exposure
    -   No selection by outcome
-   Can be prospective or retrospective

::: notes

In a cross-sectional design, you're sample is a single group of patients. You don't go hunting for controls among unexposed patients. You don't go hunting for controls among the non-cases. It's the ultimate in one stop shopping.

You might have trouble sometimes determining the difference between a cross-sectional study and a cohort study. Did you select a single group, which naturally divided itself into an exposed cohort and un-exposed controls?  Or did you select an exposed cohort and then separately find an unexposed set of controls?

Cross-sectional designs can be prospective or retrospective.

:::

## Cross-sectional designs (2 of 3)

-   Disadvantages
    -   Confusion about temporal ordering
    -   Selection bias, confounding

::: notes

It was a physicist, John Archibald Cox, who notes that "time is nature's way of keeping everything from happening all at once." True enough, but in a cross sectional design, you collect data all at once about exposures and outcomes and sometimes you can get confused about what happened first.

There's a bad joke about a statistician who examined fire department records and concluded that the more fire trucks you send to the scene of a fire, the more damage that they cause.

In general, an exposure has to occur before the outcome in order to conclude that it caused the outcome. And this might be easy to miss in a cross-sectional design.

Like the cohort design, the cross-sectional design has problems with selection bias and confounding.

:::

## Cross-sectional designs (3 of 3)

-   Advantages
    -   Examine multiple risk factors, multiple outcomes
    -   Realistic setting

::: notes

There are several advantages to a cross-sectional design.

Because you are not selecting a single exposure or a single outcome, you have a lot of flexibility to explore multiple exposures against multiple outcomes.

The cross-sectional design is also the most natural and intuitive setting for a research study. You can envision a sampling process that produces this study and in many settings, this sampling produces a realistic picture of the health care process. More realistic than the case control design certainly, and more realistic, possibly, than the cohort designs where the two groups have an artificial distinction between them. You could even argue that a cross-sectional design is more natural than a randomized control trial, because volunteer bias and the extra attention that are part and parcel of a randomized trial make it, at times, a poor representation of how health care is delivered.

-   Controls separated by time
    -   Similar to the single group, pre-post measurement
-   Sometimes separated by space
    -   Similar to the two group, post measurement only
-   Often separated by both space and time

::: notes

In a historical control design, control patients are separated by time. Current patients are compared with earlier patients. This may remind you of the quasi-experimental design where you have a single group and get measurements both at baseline and after the intervention.

Sometimes a historical control group represents a setting where the control patients are separated by distance. All of the exposed patients are at your clinic and the controls come from a different clinic.

More often, though, the historical control group is separated from the exposed group by space AND by time. You compare today's patients are your clinic with yesterday's patients at a different clinic.

:::

## Historical control designs (2 of 2)

-   Disadvantages
    -   Confounding 
-   Advantages
    -   Cheap and easy
-   Settings with 100% morbidity or mortality

::: notes

Confounding is an issue for any observational study, but with the other three types of studies, you can try to control for this with careful selection of the control group. You can also use matching or statistical adjustments and these often can help a lot.

The historical control study, in most people's minds, is beyond repair. The separation in time and space pretty much guarantees confounding and there really are no remedies that you can apply during the design or during the analysis that will convince anyone that there isn't an alternate explanation that is an equally or more convincing explanation for the results you have found.

The big advantage of the historical control design is time and money. Your historical control group is, by definition, already sitting there waiting for you to use it. In most cases, the historical control group comes cheap or even for free.

Everyone sneers at a historical control group and for once I might be tempted to sneer at it also. There is one exception, though. If an exposure is associated with near 100% morbidity or mortality, then a historical control group works just fine. You would be hard pressed to convince anyone to forgo a treatment in this setting, so why even try. The point, though, is that any improvement will be patently obvious in a disease that, left to its own, kills almost everyone that it touches.

[Material deleted and moved to my web site]

::: notes

In this part of my lecture, I was going to point out how easy it is to confuse various types of observational studies for one another. This is usually because of sloppy writing on the part of the authors of journal articles.

Anyway, that portion of my lecture probably hurt more than it helped. Identifying someone else's observational design as case-control, cohort, or cross-sectional is difficult. But you should have much less trouble identifying what your own observational design is. I am cutting this out of the lecture and including it on my web page instead.

## Causation and observational designs

-   Observational designs CAN establish a causal relationship
    -   Just requires more work
    -   Control for confounding
    -   Bring in external evidence
-   Hill's nine criteria (strength, consistency, specificity, temporality, biological gradient, plausibility, experiment, analogy)

::: notes

Your book states very strongly that only randomized trials can establish a cause and effect relationship. Quasi-experiments can sometimes suggest or hint at a cause and effect relationship. And non-experimental studies are pretty much incapable of anything.

This persective is held by many in the research community, but it is wrong, wrong, wrong. 

Observational designs can establish a causal relationship. Let me repeat this, because it is important. Observational designs can establish a causal relationship.

You just have to work a bit harder at it. Confounding, for example, is a serious problem for all observational studies, but there are tools like matching that can control for confounding during the design phase, or propensity score analysis, that can control for confounding during the analysis phase. You don't, necessarily have to resort to these approaches in a randomized trial (though they can't hurt). The point is that pretty much any reasonable randomized trial can establish a causal relationship. But in observational studies, only the very best studies can establish a causal relationship.

The other thing about observational studies is that there is strength in numbers. It is usually not just one study that establishes a cause and effect relationship. It is a series of studies. So your current observational study has to rely on information external to that study because by itself, it may not be strong enough.

I want to review Sir Austin Bradford Hill's criteria for establishing a causal relationship. He wrote a landmark paper in 1965 in the midst of the crisis in the research community about the link between smoking and lung cancer (more on that in a bit). He looked at the evidence that had accumulated and elucidated nine factors that you can use to help establish a causal relationship. None of these by themselves is sufficient, but a reasonable combination of them makes your argument quite persuasive.

:::

## Hill's criteria (1 of 9)

-   Strength
    -   Large effects can only be overturned by large confounders.
    -   Weak effects can still be real

::: notes

Hill identified the strength of the association as being the most critical factor. The reason for this is that a strong effect could only be overturned by a strong confounder. A weak confounder would only attenuate things a bit. If you want to hypothesize that a third factor among smokers (poor diet, dangerous work conditions, or lack of exercise) could cause the ten to twenty fold increase in the risk of lung cancer, that third factor would have to increase the risk of lung cancer by more ten or twenty fold.

Keep in mind, though, that weak effects can still be real. There was some criticism of a government report that said that the number of deaths due to smoking was around 450 thousand people per year. The critics dissected this number and said, we'll allow you the deaths due to cancer, but not for other factors like stroke and heart attacks, because these only showed a two fold or smaller increase in risk. It turns out that these other ways that smoking can kill you are very real, but because these causes of death (unlike lung cancer) are fairly common in the general population, you can't just get a large increase in risk. If 30% of the public dies from heart attacks, a ten fold increase is just impossible.

When the association is small, you don't totally disregard it. You just have to rely on some of the other criteria.

The other point, that has been made in many settings is that a large effect can be easily produced by a seriously flawed study. Paul Rosenbaum, in his book, Observational Studies discusses a non-randomized study conducted by Linus Pauling that showed a four fold increase in the survival times in patients with advanced cancer who received mega-doses of Vitamin C, and then points out the serious flaw that caused this finding.

:::

## Hill's criteria (2 of 9)

-   Consistency
    -   Replication across DIFFERENT study types

::: notes

Consistency is also important. A single positive result in a single observational study could possibly be the result of various biases. A second positive result in a second study that is substantially different than the first study, could possibly be the result of a different set of biases. But by the time the third result comes along, in a study different that the first two, it becomes awfully hard to argue that there is a third set of biases. Biases can work in both directions, and it would be rare that all of these biases would conspire to work together towards a common goal.

Now, if the same study is replicated more or less consistently, then replication doesn't help that much.

:::

## Hill's criteria (3 of 9)

-   Specificity
    -   Multiple cures or common bias?
    -   Deliberate inclusion of negative outcomes
    -   Exceptions: aspirin, smoking
  
::: notes

Specificity means that a treatment cures one and only one disease. If it appears to cure a multitude of diseases, then what is probably happening is that there is a bias (maybe selection bias?) that is causing the exposure group to be healthier than the control group. If an exposure is causing a multitude of problems, maybe a bias is causing the exposure group to be sicker than the control group.

You can rule out a healthier or sicker exposure group if you show that only one outcome (or only a small number of outcomes) is changed between the exposed and unexposed groups. You can take advantage of this by deliberately including outcome measures that you would expect to be negative.

Suppose you are testing whether toll booth workers suffer problems from CO poisoning. You'd get your toll booth workers and compare them to a control group and see if you have more problems with headache, nausea, dizziness, and fatigue. These are all symptoms associated with carbon monoxide poisoning. But what if the people who work in toll booths aren't really sicker, but because they have such a dreary job, they are more likely to complain.

To check for this, ask about muscle pain, rashes, coughing, sneezing, fevers: symptoms that are not normally associated with CO poisoning. If these are elevated in the toll booth workers, then you know that you just have a bunch of complainers on your hands. If these show little or no change, while the symptoms specific to CO poisoning do show a change, then you have stronger evidence that something real is going on.

:::

## Hill's criteria (4 of 9)

-   Temporality
    -   A has to precede B to be a cause
    -   Advantage of prospective studies
    -   Difficult for long latency diseases
  
::: notes

If you cannot establish temporality, then you have a harder time establishing causation. 

This is easier in a prospective study. When you are recalling events in the past, it is easier to get them out of order. This is an issue I mentioned earlier with cross-sectional studies.

There were some speculations about how cancer causes smoking. This seems like a reversal of the causal model, but the argument was that some people have a genetic disposition to cancer and the same set of genes might also make them easier to get addicted. The argument doesn't hold water, of course, but you need that genetic link to keep from being totally disregarded.

Temporality is tricky for a disease that has a long latency period, one that hides quietly in your body for many years before revealing itself. Did the disease change your diet rather than your diet producing the disease?

:::

## Hill's criteria (5 of 9)

-   Biological gradient
    -   Dose response relationship
    -   Rule out some, but not all confounders
    -   Hormesis and other patterns
  

::: notes

A biological gradient means that as the intensity of your intervention increases, the larger the improvement you see in your outcome. For an exposure, a biological gradient means that the greater the amount of exposure, the greater the degree of harm.

The biological gradient is often referred to as a dose-response relationship. If you have the ability to measure several levels of an intervention or exposure, it can help. Some, but not all, biasing factors tend to bias at a constant rate, not at a rate that escalates in a dose-response pattern.

For example, recall bias is a big problem in retrospective studies. People's memory of the past is influenced by what has happened to them recently. It's not that one group is making things up, but rather that the controls are more likely to overlook things.

Recall bias, though, is unlikely to be stronger in patients with a greater exposure, so if you see a gradient, with low exposures showing smaller effects than large exposures, that's good news. You can rule out recall bias and maybe selection bias and maybe even other biases if they affect your comparison more or less uniformly across the spectrum of exposures.

Hormesis is a surprising, but not too unusual pattern where you see a helpful effect for a small dose of something that is decidely harmful for larger doses. There is some evidence, for example, that a small amount of wine (e.g., one glass per day) has some beneficial effects, even though a larger amount of alcohol consumption causes all sorts of problems. So failure to see a dose response pattern is not a disqualifying event.

:::

## Hill's criteria (6 of 9)

-   Plausibility
    -   Biological mechanism
    -   Dependent on current state of knowledge

::: notes

Plausibility is a measure of whether a result is consistent with what we know about medicine. It is often referred to as a plausible biological mechanism.

It is commonly cited as a factor in deciding whether a result should be trusted, but in the original 1965 publication, Sir Austin Bradford Hill seems somewhat unimpressed. He points out, correctly, that our knowledge of mechanisms changes over time. 

There is also a fair amount of subjectivity in this term. Just to cite one extreme example, there was a surge about a decade ago in prayer studies where patients were randomly assigned to either receive prayers from a stranger or to a control group. There is certainly a big difference in opinion about whether it is plausible to believe in a God who intercedes in our lives when we pray to Him.

The other problem with plausibility is that it is not too hard to come up with a biological mechanism for just about anything. So oral contraceptives could have an effect on the risk of breast cancer, but the mechanism could be an adverse effect because of the estrogen in oral contraceptives, or you could just as easily come up with a mechanism that is protective because of the progestin.

In spite of Hill's reservations, a plausible mechanism is a great thing to have on your side. Lack of plausibility, however, could just mean that we haven't discovered the mechanism yet.

:::

## Hill's criteria (7 of 9)

-   Coherence
    -   Follows natural history
    -   Consistent with biology

::: notes

The remaining criteria are less frequently cited, but I want to mention them anyway for the sake of completeness.

Coherence means that the results of the research are consistent with what you know about the natural history and biology of the disease. It sounds a bit like having a plausible mechanism, but I think that Sir Austin Bradford Hill is talking about something a bit more indirect than a mechanistic explanation.

:::

## Hill's criteria (8 of 9)

-   Experiment

::: notes

Sir Austin Bradford Hill developed his nine criteria for settings where direct experimental manipulation of the exposure would be impossible, but sometimes you can find an indirect way to run an experiment.

There are settings called natural experiments where a change in exposure was mandated by some fluke or accident. This is not as good as randomization, but the nature of the accident was unlikely to produce serious biases. This could be a law passed to ban import of pesticides, or a change in alcohol taxes. See the Craig 2012 article in the recommended readings.

You might also be able to run an experiment with random assignment not to a particular exposure but rather to an intervention that is hoped might reduce the exposure. So, you can't randomly assign women to breast feeding versus bottle feeding, partly because it would be unethical and partly because of strong patient preference. But what you can do it to encourage every new mother to breast feed her child for six months. And then for a randomly selected subset of these patients, you would give them extra resources, such as access to a lactation consultant, free breast pumps, and regular visits by a home nurse. If those extra resources provided a significant change in breast feeding, then you would probably be able to measure improvements in the health and well-being of both the child and the mother.

:::

## Hill's criteria (9 of 9)

-   Analogy
    -   Similar to coherence?

::: notes

This is the weakest and hardest to understand of Hill's nine criteria. It requires a creative way of thinking.

A paper by Fedak in your recommended reading suggests that the similarity in shape between carbon nanotubes and asbestos fibers might allow you to make an analogous claim about the cancer causing properties of carbon nanotubes.

## Analysis of Qualitative Data 

-   Qualitative – 5 main approaches
	+ Phenomenology
	+ Grounded theory
	+ Ethnography
	+ Case study
	+ Narrative
-   Relies on a constructivist philosophy
    -   Rejection of the single reality of positivism
    -   Research protocol adapts as new information emerges

::: notes

Even if you never run a qualitative research study, you need to get an appreciation for how these studies are designed. They complement quantitative studies well and answer questions that would be difficult or impossible to answer with quantitative methods.

These approaches are all inductive (using specific findings to develop broader theories). You are trying to develop a framework of understanding. Don't go in with a heavy set of expectations.

Qualitative research relies heavily on a construcivist philosophy. This philosophy is a rejection of positivism, the belief that there is a an objective truth and that there is an objective method to get at this truth. The research methodology is adaptive. How you collect information changes all along the way. 

This sounds subjective, but the constructivist argues that you become more objective when you put aside your pre-conceived notions and assumptions.

I hope to talk more about this in week 12.

:::

## Qualitative research: phenomenology (1 of 3)

-   Phenomenom: "an observable fact or event" (Merriam-Webster)
	+ What meaning do people place on this fact or event?
	+ How do people construct their own reality around certain events

::: notes

One definition of "phenomenon" is something the you observe. You want to find how different people place their own meanning on this fact or event. 

You have to try to understand from the perspective of the individual.

In the constructivist philosophy, there is no single reality, but rather you construct your reality based on social relationships and interactions. Your goal as a phenomenological researcher is to put aside your construction of reality and try to understand how others construct their reality.

The phenomenological approach was used to answer three questions:

"(1) How do patients handle and overcome experienced changes after stroke? (2) How do they experience the support to handle these changes during the first year after stroke? (3) How do the similarities and differences transpire in Danish and Norwegian contexts?"

The researchers identified four main issues.

"The participants described four main issues in the recovery process that impacted the experienced changes: (i) strategies and personal factors that promote motivation, (ii) the involvement of family, social network, and peers, (iii) professionals' support, and (iv) social structures that limit the recovery process."

## Qualitative research: grounded theory (1 of 3)

-   Generate theory from data collected from participants
	+ Inferences firmly "grounded" in the data
	+ Prior theoretical expectations avoided
	+ Sampling proceeds parallel to data collection & analysis
	+ Research maintains skepticism, seeks disconfirming examples

::: notes

Grounded theory is the development of a new theory through the personal experiences of individuals. These experiences are primary: your theory is grounded in the data you collect and you need to put aside an existing theoretical beliefs. The sampling process is conditional, and as you collect more data on personal experiences, you may wish to explore different perspectives from a different group. You need to be skeptical and look actively for information that may disconfirm what you think you have already discovered.

This study aimed to understand these choices and explore the reasons behind them."

The case study is an in-depth examination of a case. It is not clear, to me anyway, what the difference is between a case and a phenomenon. The case could represent a single case, meaning the experiences of one person in a particular setting, or it could represent a series of people. The resources in this area stress the importance of examining the case from a variety of different perspectives.

The case study is not the same as a case report. The case report typically uses a factual reporting (mostly quantitative) of an unusual occurence for a single patient.

It is important to define the case narrowly with respect to time, location, demographics, or other factors.

The case study tries to identify the unusual or the outlier rather than the typical or average.

::: notes

I'm going to have some harsh words for you now, but you need to hear them. Researchers don't always make the world a better place.

There is an increasing recognition that research often tends to benefit the person doing the research, and not the people who participate in the research. In fact, sometimes the research harms the participants, through stigmatization, condescending attitudes, and the reinforcement of harmful stereotypes. Researchers have abused their position by deceiving the research participants about the true goal of the research. They often fail to recognize and respects standards within the communities that they conduct their research in. There is also often a sense of abandonment, once the research is done, the participants never see or hear anything about the work.

This is not true about all research and all researchers. It isn't even true about most research, I hope. But it does happen much more often than it should and it "poisons the well" and makes future research more difficult.

-   Designed in collaboration with the people being researched
-   Also known as Participatory Action Research (PAR)

::: notes

Community Based Participatory Research (CBPR) is an effort to avoid many of these abuses by actively engaging the community in all aspects of the research from the planning to the conduct to the write-up of the results. It is also known by the acronym PAR (Participatory Action Research).

CBPR is not restricted to any particular type of research (e.g., qualitative versus quantitative), except that research in the community is, by definition, field research.

CBPR is not easy. It takes a lot more time. You need excellent communication skills, and especially listening skills.

It also will make you feel quite a bit uncomfortable. You will be working with people who are quite different than you are, who have different needs, and different values. And if you're like 90% of all researchers, you're an introvert to begin with. I'm sure that your comfort level will improve over time, but I've been told that getting started is quite awkward.

-   Advantages to you, the researcher
    -   Precisely targeted intervention
    -   Improved participation rate
    -   Greater generalizability
-   Advantages to the community
    -   Sustainability
    -   Greater community capacity

::: notes

There are several big advantages to you, the researcher. By involving the participants in the research planning, you will be better able to target your intervention to the specific needs of this particular community. Second, the people in the community who help you plan the research will know better than you do how to design your study to make it attractive for the research participants. This will greatly improve your participation rate. The process of involving the community will almost always place the research in a more naturalistic context, which improves your generalizability.

There are advantages to the community beyond just making you, the researcher, less arrogant. When the community makes a commitment to the research process this insures a better level of sustainability.

The community based process helps the community grow and develop more capacity for research (and research that actually benefits them). They know as little about your world as you know about theirs. They, like you, will learn new skills. This will help the community in their interactions with future researchers.

## Getting started with CBPR

-   Pick a problem 
    -   Simple
    -   Important
    -   Needed
-   Ideal settings
    -   Health disparities
    -   Complex interventions
-   Identify resources
-   Keep an open mind
-   Be willing to compromise

::: notes

If you are new to CBPR, start with something that is simple, important, and needed. Pick something that you know should add value to the community. 

CBPR has been applied effectively in health disparities research because often you are already doing quite well in some communities, but there are barriers in other communities that keep you from delivering a uniformly high quality of care. The community can help you identify and overcome those barriers.

CBPR is also ideal for complex interventions, because the community can help you package the components that are most important from their perspective.

Identify people who can be resources. Keep an open mind about the process. There is little value in insisting on a rigid approach. Also understand that compromise will be necessary. You need to sacrifice some of the things that you want in order to get the cooperation of people who have different goals than you do.

## Emphasize your strengths

-   Things you know that they don't
    -   Existing research evidence
    -   Ability to diagnose
    -   Natural course and history of disease
    -   How to measure
    -   Research standards
  
::: notes

When you are working with a community, you can't be arrogant, but you can't hide your light under a bushel either. The community will look to you for your expertise. You know more than they do about what has been published in the literature. Your medical background makes you an expert in diagnosing disease, knowing what treatments are available, and what happens when a disease is left untreated.

You also have the advantage of understanding the standards of research, ESPECIALLY BECAUSE YOU HAAVE HAD THE BENEFIT OF SUCH A GREAT TEACHER IN YOUR RESEARCH METHODS CLASS!!! You know about the need to measure carefully and objectively, the value of a control group, and how to prepare results that are persuasive in the research community.

## Understand the strengths of the community members

-   Things that they know that you don't
    -   Specific needs of their community
    -   Where to find research volunteers
    -   What they will and will not tolerate
    -   How to tweak an intervention
    -   Pragmatic advice

::: notes

What you are looking for in the community is insights into the local context. The community knows best what their specific needs are and can help you prioritize. They know where to find volunteers, and can tell you what they will do and what they will refuse to do. They know how to adapt your proposed intervention to the special features of their community. In general, they offer very pragmatic advice about how to make a good fit between your research and their community.
